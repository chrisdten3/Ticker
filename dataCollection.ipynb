       "  'text': 'PLANO, Texas — The top-selling SUV in the United States will exclusively be offered as a hybrid model as part of a redesign of the RAV4 lineup,\\xa0Toyota Motor\\xa0announced Tuesday night.\\n\\nThe world’s\\xa0largest automaker\\xa0said the 2026 Toyota RAV4 only will be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating a traditional gas engine in the vehicle for the first time. It will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but with hybrid technologies such as batteries and electric motors.\\n\\nDespite a slower-than-expected\\xa0adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers have looked to\\xa0hybrid models\\xa0— which combine electric vehicle technologies with traditional internal combustion engines — to increase performance and help them meet fuel economy regulations.\\n\\nToyota, which started offering hybrids with the\\xa0Toyota Prius in late 1990s, has been a global leader and advocate for hybrid adoption, despite an industry push in recent years for automakers to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles.\\n\\nToyota’s electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. — including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles — accounted for 43.1% of the company’s 2.3 million units sold domestically in 2024.\\n\\nRAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year to nearly 475,200 units sold, including a 29.3% increase in RAV4 hybrids and 19.3% gain in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids.\\n\\nSales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models\\xa0reached a record 20%\\xa0of new car and truck sales in the U.S. last year, to 3.2 million electrified vehicles, according to auto data firm Motor Intelligence. That encompasses 1.9 million hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, and 1.3 million all-electric models.\\n\\n# Hybrid-only\\n\\nDavid Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said the company decided to exclusively offer the RAV4 as a hybrid because of its already established popularity and growing customer demand.\\n\\n“The hybrid is faster turning; it has more sales orders on it, and the consumers and dealers are asking for it,” he told CNBC Tuesday during an event at the automaker’s North American headquarters. “It was pretty clear that the consumer is voting for the hybrid.”\\n\\nChrist said the automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.\\n\\nSeven of Toyota’s current vehicles are exclusively hybrid models, including the Camry and Prius cars, Sienna minivan and Sequoia SUV. RAV4 will be the eighth.\\n\\nRAV4 hybrids accounted for 44% of sales last year, Toyota reported, while plug-in models — which offer all-electric ranges with a traditional engine that needs to be plugged in — were 6.5%.\\n\\nThe redesigned RAV4 is set to go on sale at U.S. Toyota dealerships in later this year. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign of the vehicle that included interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to the vehicle’s performance and technologies.\\n\\nThe company declined to disclose pricing until closer to the vehicle’s launch. The current RAV4 starts at $30,645. The hybrid variant starts at about $33,700. Pricing includes mandatory delivery fees.\\n\\nThe RAV4 has steadily increased sales since its U.S. introduction for the 1996 model year. Last year’s sales of the vehicle increased 9.3% year-over-year to a new record — making it the best-selling non-pickup nameplate in the U.S. last year.\\n\\n# Tariffs\\n\\nThe RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President\\xa0Donald Trump’s ongoing\\xa0tariffs\\xa0of 25% on vehicles imported into the U.S., as well as many auto parts.\\n\\nToyota produces the RAV4 at a\\xa0plant\\xa0in Kentucky, but a majority of its U.S. sales come from vehicles built at a plant in Ontario, Canada. It currently exclusively imports plug-in hybrid models for U.S. consumers from Japan.\\n\\nRoughly half of Toyota’s U.S. sales are imported from outside of the U.S., including 84.3% of RAV4 models, as well as its popular Tacoma midsize pickup truck from Mexico.\\n\\nMark Templin, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said the company plans to produce more RAV4 models at its Kentucky plant, but declined to offer specific plans for potential changes in production to mitigate tariffs.\\n\\n“It’ll work its way out. I think we’ll build more RAV4s in Kentucky, which will help. But that’s such a big volume car. … It was the No. 1 selling vehicle in the entire market, even beating out the F-150,” he told CNBC. “Now we’re bringing out one that’s even better than that car. So, I think that we’re going to need multiple plants to build that.”\\n\\nCox Automotive reports the RAV4 finished third in sales last year behind the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado truck models, which include several variants. However, other\\xa0third-party data firms\\xa0have said the RAV4 topped sales of the Detroit pickups last year when breaking out the models, such as the Ford F-150 from the larger group.\\n\\nToyota’s days’ supply — an adjusted number based on the rate of sales — has been among the lowest in the automotive industry, especially for the RAV4.\\n\\nCox Automotive reports Toyota’s recent\\xa0days’ supply is at 29 days and the RAV4 is among the fastest-selling vehicles in the automotive industry.\\xa0The industry average is 66 days, according to Cox.\\n\\nTemplin said the automaker has been conducting scenario planning for different tariff and production outcomes, but the situation remains fluid amid Trump’s trade negotiations with other countries.\\n\\n“The worst thing for an industry is uncertainty,” Templin said. “Consistency is the best thing we could all ask for.”\\n\\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/toyota-2026-rav4-hybrid.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/toyota-2026-rav4-hybrid.html)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Klarna’s customers are having a harder time paying back the installment loans they take out with the popular \"buy now, pay later\" service.\\n\\nThe Swedish company’s net losses doubled in the first quarter even as its user base and revenue grew, Klarna\\xa0reported Monday, weeks after\\xa0pausing its plans to go public\\xa0over concerns about tariffs and economic uncertainty. Klarna’s consumer credit losses swelled 17% in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier, hitting $136 million.\\n\\nIndustrywide, BNPL borrowers are increasingly falling behind on their loan payments. In a survey conducted by the credit platform LendingTree last month,\\xa041% of users said they paid late\\xa0within the last year, up from 34% the previous year. At least a quarter of BNPL users took out loans to pay for groceries, the survey found, up from 14%.\\n\\nThe debt strain among BNPL customers coincides with broader signs of stretched household finances. U.S. consumer debt rose by $167 billion to\\xa0hit a record $18.2 trillion\\xa0in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week. Credit card balances fell, as they typically do in the months after the holidays, along with auto loan debt. But\\xa0student loan delinquencies surged\\xa0from less than 1% to almost 8% as\\xa0the Trump administration cracks down\\xa0on federal student loan borrowers.\\n\\nIt’s against this backdrop that BNPL services\\xa0continue to extend their reach\\xa0throughout the consumer economy. Klarna recently deposed rival Affirm\\xa0to become Walmart’s exclusive BNPL provider. And in March, it\\xa0joined forces with food delivery service DoorDash, adding to industrywide efforts that have made near-instant access to credit increasingly ubiquitous\\xa0for even small-dollar, routine purchases.\\n\\nA Klarna spokesperson said the 17% jump in consumer credit losses “doesn’t tell you much about the U.S. consumer” and pointed instead to the company’s credit losses as a share of the total sum it loaned out, or “gross merchandise value.” This metric rose from 0.51% to 0.54%, the spokesperson said, “so a very slight increase but still very low.”\\n\\n# Read More \\n\\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/buy-now-pay-never-klarna-users-struggle-repay-loans-us-consumer-debt-s-rcna207940](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/buy-now-pay-never-klarna-users-struggle-repay-loans-us-consumer-debt-s-rcna207940)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) stock\\xa0sank 18%\\xa0in Wednesday morning trading, following an 8% decline on Tuesday, after Federal Housing Finance Agency director William J. Pulte called for the\\xa0provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\" and for the privatization of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC).\\n\\nPulte specifically referred to Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) and its price increase for mortgage scores during Q&A at a mortgage industry conference on Tuesday. \"I think FICO should make sure they’re being as economical as possible,\" he said. \"We’re actively looking at getting it done. I don’t like some things I’ve heard in terms of the cost.\"\\n\\nBoth Oppenheimer and Jefferies issued notes defending FICO.\\n\\nJefferies advised clients to buy the dip. \"We continue to believe there is no material risk to FICO\\'s long-term goal of increasing its share of economics within mortgage,\" analyst Surinder Thind wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nPulte also proposed transitioning to a two-credit bureau report format from the current three-bureau, or tri-merge, format. The proposal is an option for lenders, not a requirement, noted Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, who believes that investors are overreacting to the comments.\\n\\nThe comment on making FICO more economical centers on the company\\'s price increase on FICO mortgage scores to $4.95 per score in January 2025. Lau noted that the cost of the score only accounts for 25 basis points of the average mortgage closing cost of $6,000 and is the lowest compared with other costs such as tax stamp, appraisal, title insurance, and notary fees. \"We believe FICO still has a strong argument for the price increase,\" he said. \"It is unclear on what FHFA can do to limit FICO\\'s price increase.\"\\n\\nThe privatization of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC), meanwhile, could open up credit score companies to more competition. But it would likely have little impact on FICO Score pricing, because it is so embedded in the mortgage lending and securitization processes, the analyst said. The score is reflected in 90%+ market shares in all public asset-backed securitization products.\\n\\nRegarding the option for a bi-merge report, instead of tri-merge, the Oppenheimer analyst doesn\\'t expect that most lenders will switch to two credit bureaus as it would reduce originations and increase consumer costs. TransUnion (TRU), a FICO competitor, has estimated that if 5% of all new mortgage applications use bi-merge reports, \\\\~600K of those mortgages could result in higher interest rates with consumers paying $6,600 higher interest payments over the next 10 years.\\n\\nJefferies\\' Thind agrees that there\\'s little likelihood a transition to bi-merge would significantly affect FICO, pointing to pushback from the Mortgage Bankers Association, five other industry groups, and several Republican senators who want to codify the tri-merge report into law. \"If the bi-merge were implemented and all lenders adopted it, our calculations suggest the maximum negative impact to FICO, EFX, and TRU adj EPS would be roughly -16%, -10%, and -10%, respectively,\" the analyst wrote.\\n\\nOpenheimer\\'s Lau\\'s overall view of FICO\\'s (NYSE:FICO) stock decline: \"There are still a lot of details that have to be flushed out, but the knee-jerk reaction to Director Pulte\\'s comments seems excessive. FICO Scores hold strong inherent value and remain integral to the mortgage lending ecosystem.\"\\n\\nLau has Outperform ratings on Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO), Equifax (EFX), and TransUnion (TRU).\\n\\nEquifax (EFX) stock\\xa0fell 5.7%,\\xa0and TransUnion (TRU)\\xa0slid 5.9%.',\n",

The upcoming of online brokers such as Robinhood (USA) or Trade Republic (Germany) along with rising standards of living and GDP per capita made it far more feasible for retail investors and the general public to invest into equities. I am a 27 year old German and my generations parents had little to no exposure to investing into stocks. For people  from my generation however it is hard to find someone who doesn’t allocate at least a small portion of income into equities. \\n\\nIn my opinion, this trend of increasing investment inflow from retail investors should establish itself in other markets and parts of the world soon enough.

A company to watch closely as EV’s grow. \\n\\nFrom Bloomberg: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. jumped in its Hong Kong trading debut after the Chinese battery giant wrapped up the world’s biggest listing this year by raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) despite being blacklisted by the Pentagon and grinding through geopolitical storms.\\n\\nShares of CATL, as the largest maker of electric-vehicle batteries is known, climbed 16% to HK$306.20 on Tuesday. Though Hong Kong shares of Chinese companies typically trade at a discount to those in the mainland, CATL soared above its stock price in Shenzhen, where it rose 1.2%.\\n\\nFor investors, the allure of buying into a blue-chip stock at the forefront of electric-vehicle technology outweighed the risks of getting caught up in the ongoing turbulence in Sino-US relations. The success of the stock offering, which may increase to $5.3 billion if CATL exercises an option to do so, single-handedly doubled Hong Kong’s proceeds from listings this year and could embolden other companies to go public. \\n\\nCATL is “a true champion enabling the energy transition, a symbol of China’s success as a global green leader,” said Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital Group. \\n\\nPriced at around 17 times current earnings multiples, CATL’s Hong Kong shares have room to rise 50%, driven by strong earnings and attractive valuations, said Johnson Wan, head of China industrials research at Jefferies in Hong Kong. \\n\\nCATL supplies batteries to top-tier customers such as Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. It has a market share of roughly 38% in electric-car batteries, comfortably ahead of its closest challenger, top EV maker BYD Co.’s 17%, according to SNE Research.\\n\\nThe Ningde, Fujian-based company generated sales of $50 billion and net income of $7 billion last year.

       "  'title': 'What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI',\n",
       "  'text': \"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\\n\\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\\n\\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\\n\\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\\n\\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\\n\\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\\n\\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\\n\\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\\n* Motherboards\\n* Power supplies\\n* GPU trays\\n\\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\\n\\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\\n* Network switches\\n* Rack management software\\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\\n\\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\\n\\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\\n\\nNow lets go more in depth:\\n\\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\\n\\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\\n\\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\\n\\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\\n\\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\\n\\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\\n* Power delivery + networking\\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\\n* Software/BIOS optimization\\n\\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\\n\\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\\n\\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\\n\\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\\n\\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\\n\\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\\n\\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\\n\\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\\n\\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|**SMCI**|**\\\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\\n\\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\\n\\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\\n\\nClients benefit from:\\n\\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\\n\\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\\n\\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\\n\\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\\n\\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\\n\\nSMCI is building out:\\n\\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\\n\\nThis allows SMCI to:\\n\\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\\n\\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\\n\\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\\n\\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\\n\\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\\n\\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\\n\\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\\n\\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\\n\\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\\n\\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\\n\\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\\n\\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\\n\\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\\n\\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\\n\\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\\n\\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\\n\\n* SMCI can output \\\\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\\n\\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\\n\\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\\n\\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\\n\\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\\n\\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\\n\\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\\n\\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\\n\\n\\n\\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\\n\\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\\n\\n  \\nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\\n\\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\",\n",

But as those inventories wind down, the more-expensive goods ordered after April 2 will hit the shelves. (For Walmart, that’s expected to happen next month.)\\n\\nBusinesses are already absorbing the costs, according to the latest gauge of US wholesale inflation, known as the Producer Price Index. Last month, wholesale prices actually fell, which sounds like a good thing until you look a little closer at why.\\n\\nThe dip in the PPI came from a plunge in “trade services,” a category that measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. Essentially, that means producers are letting higher input costs eat into their profit margins while they try to figure out what to do.\\n\\nConsumers are pulling back even more than economists expected.

       "  'text': 'In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\\n\\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\\n\\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\\n\\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\\n\\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \\n\\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\\n\\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\\n\\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\\n\\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\\n\\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html',\n",

Until one Thursday when the CPI data came out. The first time the CPI data came out, all the accounts turned green within an hour.\\n\\nSeriously, the things that most people care about every day don't really matter that much. And the ones that really matter? Often boring, easy to ignore, until you are the market hard lesson.\\n\\nHere are just a few lessons I wish everyone new to the market had known earlier:\\n\\n1. Market conditions are more important than predictions\\n\\nNo one really knows where the market will go. Not CNBC, not Twitter, not the 400k karma guy who draws charts every day.Instead of guessing “what's going to happen”, learn to deal with “what's happening right now”. The market doesn't care if you think it's fair or not.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Holding money is also a position, don't look down on cash\\n\\nJust because you have a short position doesn't mean you're wimpy, sometimes it's the best strategy.\\n\\nHalf of my best months were spent waiting for opportunities. Don't force an order just because you have an itch, that's the fastest way to shrink your account.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. The market story is just noise, the real flow of funds is the focus!\\n\\nDon't rush to believe in “macro logic”, first look at what the market is really buying and selling.\\n\\nOptions volume, turnover, sector rotation - these are the facts. The news is often just an afterthought.\\n\\n  \\n4. Mindset is worth more than position\\n\\nHave you ever stared at a losing order until you started to doubt your life?\\n\\nThis is the loss of “mental funds”. Even if it is only a small loss, if it is because of the impulse to order, it will be a little bit consumed you.\\n\\nRemember: stop-loss in time not only saves money, but also saves lives.\\n\\n5. Having a plan is more important than having faith.\\n\\nWhat if you enter the market with full faith and end up going in the opposite direction?\\n\\nAnd if you have a clear entry and exit, stop loss and take profit and time schedule, then even if the direction is wrong, will not blow up the account.\\n\\nDiscipline, more profitable than judgment.\\n\\n  \\nSpeculation and options, not to be a prophet, but to manage your own behavior in the market.\\n\\nI've also experienced burst positions, blood, repeated retracements, chasing up and down, and emotional outbursts ...... only to finally realize: the only way to make money consistently is to build a system that you can execute over time.\\n\\nYou don't need to be perfect. You just need to live long enough to really become strong\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish you all the best of luck in your business. If you are also a market investor, feel free to share the potholes you've stepped in and the things you've learned in the comments section. Let's make progress together!\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Root problem Employment Rate-- there is no market prospect for Tesla, Cyber\\u200b\\u200bCAB and all Robotaxi industry.Tesla's Second Death Knell\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Many so-called \"business analysts\" and \"securities analysts\" compare Tesla\\'s Robotaxi project CyberCAB with Uber when analyzing it, because in their perception, Uber has blown up the taxi industry, and Robotaxi will be like a warrior, blowing up Uber. But they are all wrong, because they don\\'t understand the government\\'s decision-making path at all. Of course, if the government is like an extreme capitalist and imperial government, such as China, then it is indeed possible. Otherwise, it is just fantasy. Because they ignore a fundamental problem, \"employment rate\".\\n\\nAlthough Uber has replaced a large part of the taxi market, it has compensated for a large number of driver jobs, which is why the government can default on Uber\\'s development. Although it broke the licensed taxi industry, it can provide more jobs. If Robotaxi and CyberCAB are promoted on a large scale, the government will have to face a thorny problem, and the already vulnerable jobs will become even fewer.\\n\\nSo when we put aside all the technological and technical issues and look at it from the policy and technical aspects, we will find that the government will not encourage the driverless taxi industry in terms of policy. I know a lot of people will say \"shit, look at WAYMO, how well it has been running\". Right, but have you noticed that from 2019 to now, WAYMO has only expanded one city, and no more expansion, think about why. Apart from technical reasons, more expansion requires more permits, and who would want more unemployment within their own governance except for a few regions.\\n\\nI know that from the perspective of the Silicon Valley faction, the AI \\u200b\\u200bfaction, the Musk Mars faction, and the so-called decentralized cryptocurrency faction, this is the stupidest thing for the Earth government to artificially prevent the development of technology for the so-called \"employment rate\".\\n\\nThis is actually the fundamental problem, that is, the difference between the government and the enterprise. For enterprises, layoffs only need to lose money, security can be outsourced, non-essential expenses can be cut, and even employees can bring their own toilet paper to the office. But for the government, it is a completely different consideration, because it also involves the government\\'s responsibilities and obligations to the people. Of course, if it is an extreme country like China, it can be considered less, yes, less, but it still has to be considered, pretending to be a civilized country.\\n\\nSo even if the United States, a country that does not have protection for pregnant women at the national level, still has to consider employment issues. Based on this, the so-called Robotaxi can only be a small-scale experiment.\\n\\nJust like unmanned supermarkets, Amazon in the United States has created unmanned supermarkets, which are very popular in China, but in countries like Japan, which have the most serious aging population and need to free up young labor, they are not interested in unmanned supermarkets at all. The reason why China is so interested is that it can cheat money in the capital market. After 2016, you only need to tell investors \"I have an IDEA for an unmanned supermarket.\" You can get millions of investments without even a slide or a business plan. Is anyone still talking about unmanned supermarkets now?\\n\\n  \\nUnlike Waymo, Tesla must rely on the CyberCAB project to save its precarious car sales. Waymo does not have this burden, so it can be said that it is just for fun. No one really expects it to make money or be widely used.\\n\\n  \\nTesla\\'s death knell is ringing',\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'ve seen the claim over and over that Gemini 2.5 Pro is the best LLM on the market, with many Redditors citing Chatbot arena rankings.\\n\\nI was surprised by this, because in my anecdotal experience, Gemini 2.5 pro consistently performs worse than even the faster /cheaper OpenAI models like 4o. So I looked into this, and found this paper:\\n\\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879\\n\\nThis paper points out many flaws with Chat Arena\\'s rankings, which lead to flawed results:\\n\\n1. Google is able to submit dozens of private models, retract scores they don\\'t like, and only publicly release the one that scores best. This leads to situations where they can \"cherry pick\" a model that scores best, which may either be overfitted to the benchmark, or score better by pure chance.\\n\\nThis would be like the equivalent of if you\\'re in a college class, and allowed a single notecard for a final exam. You can take the test unlimited times, but you forget the contents of the test after. You then take the test 50 times, each time changing the content of your notecard each time. Eventually, you select the test in which you scored best, and submit that, and score top of your class, because everyone else took the test less. That\\'s essentially what Google is doing.\\n\\nGoogle had the 2nd most privately tested models at 10, after Meta, at 27. In comparison, OpenAI only had 2,X ai had 1.\\n\\n2. Google has the highest \"sampling rate\" on Chatbot arena. Rather than sampling models evenly, the benchmark is biased on favor of Google. This gives them more opportunities to \"cherry pick\" the best scoring model.\\n\\n3. This process of submitting many models, and publicly releasing the one that scores leads to overfitting, or a case where a model is optimized to perform very well in a benchmark/training data, but does very poorly in real world performance.\\n\\n4. Models such as OpenAI\\'s models are trained based on real world user feedback(thumbs up/thumbs down). Google is cherry picking their models based on arbitrary queries that are not real world usage. This leads to results that do not perform well in the real world.\\n\\nIf you think Google truly has the best model, I\\'d recommend using it, and actually scrutinizing what it tells you. You\\'ll find that it frequently provides convincing responses that are completely wrong.',\n",

This strategy allowed for inflation to exceed the 2% target temporarily to compensate for previous shortfalls. However, the unforeseen surge in inflation post-pandemic has rendered this approach less effective.  ￼\\n\\n\\t* Emergence of Persistent Supply Shocks: The economy is facing more frequent and potentially enduring supply shocks, such as those stemming from tariffs, pandemics, and severe weather events. These shocks pose a dual challenge by simultaneously driving up prices and hindering economic growth, complicating the Fed’s policy decisions.  ￼\\n\\n\\t* Shift Towards Inflation Control: In light of these challenges, Powell indicated a strategic pivot back to prioritizing inflation control. The Fed aims to develop a policy framework that is robust across various economic conditions, ensuring preparedness for potential downturns while maintaining its commitment to a 2% inflation target.  ￼\\n\\n\\t* Implications for Interest Rates: While Powell did not provide specific guidance on immediate interest rate adjustments, the acknowledgment of higher real interest rates and the potential for more volatile inflation suggests that the Fed may maintain elevated rates for an extended period to anchor inflation expectations.\\n\\nThe Fed plans to unveil the revised policy framework between August and September 2025, aiming to enhance its resilience to unforeseen economic developments while upholding its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  ￼',\n",

One sell and one buy as this is not to overthink my positions but at the same time giving myself a chance to adapt to market situations each month. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall this strategy has beaten the s&p 500 comfortably last year and this year but I would like to see what you guys think cause I’m no genius and in fact I’m quite the opposite and probably can be doing something much better. \\n\\nI would also like to slowly deposit more money into my portfolio but I’m currently broke and all of my money is going into rent and living expenses so the money I saved up in college is the money that I have to work with right now',\n",

I had a serious discussion with many Tesla fans on Twitter Space in 2023. They think I am a stupid European old continent style professional manager. What public nature, what small and medium shareholders' interests. The great Musk leads Tesla to one milestone after another, which is a victory. Selling so many Tesla cars is a victory, and launching rockets again and again is a victory, why not pay salaries. A person with only a few hundred shares actually sued a key figure who made the United States great, and it was approved. This is a joke.\\n\\nI mentioned the CEO PAY RATIO and the responsibility and morality of enterprises to society, which attracted more Tesla fans, including typical investors on Reddit who think that there is no European old continent in the United States, including the stupid morality of the old world like Australia, which is a joke. In the United States, only whoever makes money is the most powerful. No need to reason, just show the holdings, full of social Darwinism theory, if you believe in Tesla, buy CALL, if you don't believe, buy PUT, why discuss science, why discuss technology and implementation routes, no need, these are all jokes. And there is no scientific spirit, just shout orders.\\n\\nBut in fact, when I think back to 2017, when I was attending an MBA course at a very small school in Australia, the teacher talked about the concept of CEO Pay Ratio, saying that American companies are as high as 300:1. That is, the gap between grassroots employees and CEOs is 300 times. And the UK, a bad country in Europe, is only 70-100 times. I knew that this salary would not satisfy Musk. Because if Musk's salary is really approved, it will bring the US Pay Ratio to an incredible level. The United States has completely lost any morality.\\n\\nAlthough the United States is indeed a country where everything is about money and whoever has money is the king, I also see that the strong Delaware judges are trying to maintain the final decency of the judiciary to give social fairness.\\n\\nCompared to the SEC, which weakly sued Musk and was even broken by Musk, the Delaware judge is the last and best shield of the United States.\\n\\nThe SEC is a regulatory unit that lacks even the most basic dignity and is far weaker than China's Securities Regulatory Commission.\",\n",

       "  'text': '> Coinbase on Thursday reported that cyber criminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data to use in social engineering attacks. The incident may cost Coinbase up to $400 million to fix, the company estimated. The crypto exchange operator received an email on May 11 from someone claiming they obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts as well as other internal Coinbase documentation, including materials relating to customer-service and account-management systems, Coinbase reported in an SEC filing. Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, affected data included sensitive data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and emails; masked bank account numbers and identifiers as well as the last four digits of social security numbers; government ID images and account balances, the company said.\\n\\n> “Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks,” the company said in a blog post. “These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker.” Coinbase had detected the breach independently in previous months, per the filing. It immediately terminated the employees involved, warned customers whose information may have been accessed and enhanced its fraud monitoring protections.\\n\\n> The threat actor paid overseas contractors and employees in support rolls to obtain the information, it said. “We’re cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received,” the company said in the blog. “Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.” Coinbase operates the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. In that past week it announced an acquisition that is expected to help it expand its global reach and gained entry to the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which will take effect next week.\\n\\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-hackers-bribed-staff-to-steal-customer-data-and-are-demanding-20-million-ransom.html',\n",

       "  'text': '# Key Takeaways\\n\\n* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.\\n* The combination will benefit\\xa0customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\\n* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\\n\\n**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA**\\xa0– Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1)\\xa0based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.\\n\\n“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.”\\xa0\\n\\nThe Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”\\n\\n“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”\\n\\n# Structure and Timing\\xa0\\n\\nIn the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on:\\xa0\\n\\n* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and\\n* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.\\n\\nAs consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:\\n\\n* \\xa0$4 billion in cash,\\n* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and\\n* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares.\\xa0\\n\\nBased on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt.\\xa0\\n\\nWithin a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing.\\xa0\\n\\n# Governance\\xa0\\n\\nFollowing the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees.\\xa0\\n\\nIt is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger.\\xa0\\n\\nUpon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters.\\xa0\\n\\n# Community Leadership\\xa0\\n\\nThe Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges.\\xa0\\n\\n# Strategic and Customer Objectives\\xa0\\n\\nFollowing the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans.\\xa0\\n\\nThe new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments. Charter customers will benefit from Cox Business’ well-known industry leadership in business telecommunications, including Segra and RapidScale.\\xa0\\n\\nCharter and Cox employees will benefit from investments in employee-focused technology and AI tools and an expansion of Charter’s self-progression career advancement model for promotions and standardized pay increases.\\xa0\\n\\n# Specific Benefits From the Combination Include:\\xa0\\n\\n* The combined company will bring together the best products and practices of each company to benefit all of the combined company’s customers and employees.\\n* The combined company will be better positioned to aggressively compete in an expanding and dynamic marketplace that includes:\\n   * Larger, national broadband companies with wireline and wireless capabilities,\\n   * Regional wireline and mobile competitors,\\n   * Global video distribution providers and platforms, and satellite broadband companies.\\n* The combined company also will be better positioned for continued and expanded investment and innovation:\\n   * In mobile, given the increased footprint;\\n   * In video, where Big Tech currently leverages global scale in content and distribution;\\n   * In advertising, where the transaction will expand opportunities for advertisers large and small, national, regional, and local, bringing new competition in an area now dominated by Big Tech;\\n   * In the business sector, where the combined company will have additional coverage, yet still remain a regional player competing against larger, national competitors;\\n   * And through greater product innovation in areas including AI tools and small cell deployment of licensed, shared licensed and unlicensed spectrum, bringing new and advanced services and capabilities to consumers and businesses.\\n* Cox customers will gain access to Charter’s simple and transparent pricing and packaging structure, including no annual contracts for any residential services, which means customers are free to change service providers at any time, with no risk of early termination fees.\\n* Cox customers also will benefit from Charter’s industry-first Customer Service Commitments, which include:\\n   * Charter’s 100% U.S.-based customer service team available 24/7.\\n   * Charter has committed to fixing service disruptions quickly, including same-day technician dispatch when requested before 5:00 pm; if not, the next day.\\n   * Charter provides customers credits for outages that last longer than two hours.\\n* This proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\\n   * The combined company will adopt Charter’s sales and service workforce model, which will fully return Cox’s customer service function to the U.S.\\n   * \\xadAll employees will earn a starting wage of\\xa0*at least*\\xa0$20 per hour and will gain access to Charter’s industry-leading benefits, which include:\\n      * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees; Charter has absorbed the full premium cost increase for the last 12 years.\\n      * Market-leading retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with a company match up to 6% of their eligible pay, with an additional 3% contribution available for most employees.\\n      * Free or discounted Spectrum Mobile, TV and Internet service.\\n      * Multiple opportunities for upward advancement and to build careers, including through tuition-free undergraduate degree and certificate programs via flexible online learning; self-progression programs with standardized pay raises, and formal development programs, such as the Broadband Field Technician Apprenticeship\\xa0program.\\n      * Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides frontline employees the ability to purchase stock and receive a matching grant of Charter Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) up to 1 for 1 based on years of service, offering employees another meaningful incentive to grow their careers with Charter.\\n* The combined company will expand Charter’s award-winning local Spectrum News stations in the Cox footprint, bringing hyper-local, unbiased news coverage to more communities. The combined company will not own any national programming,\\n* The combined company will retain its industry leadership in protecting the security of U.S. communications networks from foreign threats.\\xa0\\n\\n# Financial Outlook\\xa0\\n\\nBy deploying Charter’s operating strategy across Cox’s footprint, the combined company will:\\xa0\\n\\n* Offer Cox customers the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans,\\n* Invest in more U.S.-based employees,\\n* Continually improve service quality,\\n* And support the development of third-party platforms for new consumer products through continuing network evolution.\\xa0\\n\\nDespite those investments, the combined business is expected to produce higher cash flow per passing and investment returns over time by creating and preserving more relationships on a fixed network, selling more products to each customer, and reducing operating and capital costs per passing by lowering service transactions, churn and fixed cost leverage. \\xa0\\n\\nCharter also currently expects approximately $500 million of annualized cost synergies achieved within three years of close – stemming from typical procurement and overhead savings.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\nLink: [https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies](https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies)',\n",

       "  'text': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html\\n\\n\\n> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \\n\\n> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.\\n\\n> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\n- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\\n\\n- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected\\n\\n> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.\\n\\n> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.\\n\\n> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Why Tesla is another Enron - How can a company with a valuation equal to the world's seven largest automakers Earnings Catch-up\",\n",
       "  'text': 'So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla\\'s current valuation is equal to the sum of the world\\'s seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face \"Earnings Catch-up\", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla\\'s sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla\\'s main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?\\n\\nIn my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.\\n\\nMy teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called \"Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room\".\\n\\nTherefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past. Beliefs and slogans are like the horn of the technological paradise, gathering a large number of irrational investors.\\n\\n\\nFrom the perspective of pure finance and financial market technical theory, the financial pressure that Tesla needs to fulfill in 2026 is so great that it is suffocating, or even desperate. There have been many investors who scolded me while listening to my analysis. This is because they do not understand technology and only know how to buy and sell. In the past few years, they only read the parts of investment research reports that they like to read. They regard the risk part as a joke.\\n\\nThis involves a core issue. Musk said \"he doesn\\'t care about making cars anymore\", which is good, and it can get rid of the problem of \"car manufacturer pricing\". But it faces the second problem of \"how to price Tesla\". Robotaxi? From an objective technical point of view, it is unknown when Tesla\\'s Robotaxi will catch up with Waymo. After all, Waymo completed L4 autonomous driving as early as 2019, while FSD is still L2 to this day. Many people don\\'t know that it is actually L2, not even L3.\\n\\nBipedal robots? From the perspective of the academic community in Australia and Europe, that is a joke. Not to mention Japan, a robot powerhouse, where even FANUC is not so optimistic.\\n\\nMore carbon credits? Yes, but the scale of growth will be limited unless the White House gives more taxpayer money.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeculating on Bitcoin, using data centers to mine Bitcoin? It\\'s not impossible, after all, are they scammers?\\n\\n\\nHumankind has not made any breakthroughs in basic science since the 1980s. Europe has been working hard to make breakthroughs in basic science, so they spent a huge amount of time to build colliders, while the United States has invested billions of dollars in mining and AI. This is the problem the United States faces today.\\n\\nThis article would be worth $50,000 if I were giving a talk, so I won’t go into too much detail, just to add to the urge to pee when I wake up late at night in Australia.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"UnitedHealth Stock (UNH) Continues to Suffer from Donald Trump's Executive Order Do You Think It Will Rise Next?\",\n",
       "  'text': 'UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments. Rising medical costs, an unexpected CEO departure, and heightened regulatory uncertainty stemming from former President Trump’s recent executive order on drug pricing have all contributed to investor unease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the stock may appear attractively valued following its sharp decline, caution is warranted. The current environment remains highly uncertain, and further downside risks could materialize in the near term. As a result, I am bearish on UNH.\\n\\n\\n\\nRising Medical Costs Rattle Nerves\\n\\nUNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization. Since then, investors have naturally kept dumping shares as faith in UNH’s cost management faltered.\\n\\n\\n\\nCEO Exit Sparks Leadership Crisis\\n\\nAs the dust was settling, UNH dropped a bombshell: CEO Andrew Witty resigned abruptly two days ago for “personal reasons,” and the company withdrew its prior full-year outlook. Stephen Hemsley, a former CEO and current chairman, stepped back into the top role, but the move feels like an unplanned stopgap.\\n\\n\\n\\nWitty’s departure caps a rough year for the company, one that saw a massive cyberattack exposing the data of 190 million customers and the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Notably, the fact that his resignation came right after UNH missed earnings for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis has raised questions about what else might be going wrong behind the scenes. At 72 years of age, analysts see Hemsley as a temporary fix. So that has, reasonably so, only added to investor anxiety over the company’s lack of a long-term plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe craziest part is that UNH’s leadership void couldn’t come at a worse time. UNH faces scrutiny over soaring medical costs and public outrage tied to Thompson’s killing, which sparked debates about insurer practices. Witty had driven UNH’s revenue to $400 billion, but recent stumbles eroded confidence. With Hemsley steering a ship under regulatory and operational strain, the absence of a long-term leader risks keeping UNH’s stock in the penalty box.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump’s Drug Pricing Order Targets PBMs\\n\\nHowever, the most decisive blow landed on Monday this week, when President Trump signed an executive order to slash U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower costs abroad. This wasn’t just a hit to drugmakers as it directly aimed at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like UNH’s Optum Rx, accusing them of inflating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReuters reported that the order seeks to skip PBMs, potentially disrupting their role in negotiating drug prices. Clearly, the broader threat to Optum Rx’s margins looms large, especially as analysts warn of legal and regulatory hurdles that could prolong uncertainty.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Bargain with Baggage\\n\\nOn paper, one could argue that UNH looks like a steal. Trading at roughly 13x this year’s consensus EPS, it’s a far cry from its historical premium, while the 55% share price plunge, which has primarily taken place in just a month, suggests the market may have overreacted.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bottom line is that UNH isn’t a small-cap with a speculative business model but an insurance behemoth that generates revenues over $400 billion per annum. It has a fantastic track record of generating high returns on capital and returning cash to shareholders.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnitedHealth (UNH) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\\n\\nUnitedHealth (UNH) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\\n\\nStill, the risks are hard to ignore. Trump’s executive order could compress PBM profits if drug prices fall without offsetting gains elsewhere. And sure, UNH’s diversified business model might cushion the blow compared to peers like Cigna (CI), but the negative sentiment is palpable.\\n\\n\\n\\nLegal challenges to the order, as flagged by health policy experts, could drag out the uncertainty, keeping UN',\n",

Not sure if it\\'ll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news.

Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs).

Alibaba\\'s cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.\\n\\n[**FL (Foot Locker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FL&p=d) \\\\- Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) confirmed a $2.4B acquisition of Foot Locker at $24 per share, nearly double Foot Locker\\'s previous closing price. Currently long and interested in seeing if we can converge even closer to $24, but overall don\\'t see any other trade in this except for a reversal of news. Mainly integration challenges and potential antitrust concerns are the big risk, but unlikely with current admin.\\n\\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\\\- Tesla\\'s stock has risen from $275 to $350 over the past six days but failed to break the $350 level twice. Currently short pretty close to $350, but will bail if we break $350 (probably a lower price level like $345). TSLA has mainly been on a tear (attributed to Musk stepping away from DOGE and returning to TSLA), and the news of Tesla board exploring a new pay deal for the CEO dropped yesterday. Mainly a short play based on how parabolic the stock has been, but will bail as needed.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I am a long-term Chinese investor. I have been firmly bearish on Tesla for four years and have been laughed at by other investors for four years. But I am firm in my opinion because I am different from other investors. I have two undergraduate degrees in IT and economics, and I am also a mechanical enthusiast in my spare time. I understand mechanics, economics and IT better than others. I believe that the release date of Cybercab will be another Enron and Tesla\\'s doomsday. How can it be achieved unless his good friend, the president, helps.\\n\\nAll the achievements of BEV today are based on government subsidies. In 2024, after the European government cancelled the BEV subsidies, the sales of hybrid and Toyota immediately increased. So when countries around the world gradually canceled the subsidies for electric vehicles in the next few years, who will buy them? Of course, the president\\'s friends can ask the federal government to buy them at the government level.\\n\\nToday, Tesla\\'s market value is higher than Toyota, GM and Honda. This is really a joke.\\n\\nMany people also told me that \"Tesla is not just a car company, it is the future, Mars, artificial intelligence, and innate intelligence. It will replace all humans.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t want to discuss this topic with people who have no science and engineering background anymore. Really, there is a saying in China that \"if you don\\'t cheat a fool\\'s money, it\\'s a waste.\" These people are the same.\\n\\nSometimes I really feel strange about the US stock market. The SEC is like a thing that bullies the weak and clings to the powerful. On the contrary, even the China Banking Regulatory Commission, which is called the \"fraud market\", has always been a heavy-handed strike in regulating companies. It\\'s just that it must cooperate with the Chinese government to control stock prices and the stock market, but it has never been afraid of any company. And the SEC is too weak.',\n",

If a normal analyst puts Tesla\\'s CyberCAB product in this analysis method, he will only have one position, that is, NichePlayers, and even this is overestimating Tesla. After all, Waymo officially has L4 level autonomous driving, while Tesla\\'s FSD is only L2 (in case you haven\\'t heard, Tesla\\'s FSD is only L2, not even L3).\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo is obviously in the leader quadrant. It has launched fully autonomous Robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. It has been successfully running for six years since 2019, although there have been many funny accidents during this period. But Waymo at least dares to claim that it has L4, not L3, or L3 plus, or like FSD, which is obviously L2 but induces the driver to let go. (By the way, L2 allows the driver to take both hands off the steering wheel, and only the United States can do this in the world).\\n\\nSo Tesla doesn\\'t even have L4 autonomous driving, so what can it use to compete with Waymo, which dares to apply for L4 and uses lidar technology that is ridiculed by Tesla fans. L2 means that the responsibility is put on the driver, but L4 requires Waymo to pay for every accident with real money.\\n\\nAs of 15/May/2025 (sorry, we are used to typing dates like this in Australia). Tesla has not submitted an application for L4 autonomous driving, so I would like to ask Tesla fans. What will they use to make Cybercab on June 19? Of course, Musk\\'s good friend, a gentleman in the White House, may be able to slam the table and roar angrily, demanding that NHTSA officials unconditionally let his best political allies and election campaigners start Robotaxi business immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom my perspective, the US stock market really feels like the Nasdaq bubble in 2000. It is full of lies and incompetence at the regulatory level. The entire market is either VR, AR or AI, quantum chips (here again, quantum algorithms do not solve the problem of general computing. Before 2022, there were many research projects in the United States to study how to accelerate quantum computing for general computing, and they all failed), autonomous driving, and cryptocurrency. Remove MAG7, where is the value of the United States?\\n\\nIn my opinion, Europe is better than the United States. The European academic community does not brag about AI, but focuses on researching colliders.\\n\\nI once asked a friend from NASA, \"Why don\\'t you launch more deep space satellites to explore the universe?\" Their answer was \"Space science is not like Silicon Valley, where you can just blow bubbles. Space research requires a lot of objective conditions, and these objective conditions are calculated based on decades or even hundreds of years, such as planets connecting in a straight line. This kind of opportunity requires a long wait, and before the astronomical conditions are met, there is very little that humans can do).\\n\\nI will write about the current AI scams when I have time, which is also a purely rational analysis.\\n\\nFinally, I want to thank the administrators here.

       "  'text': 'In the past, turning water into wine was considered a biblical miracle. However, with the rise of AI, anyone can now do this incredible feat by investing in Landbridge.\\n\\nLandbridge is a company that owns land, focusing on the Delaware sub-basin within the Permian Basin. For those unaware, this region is known for having the most active oil and natural gas exploration in the US. If this sounds familiar, its business model and area of activity is similar to the highly successful Teas Pacific ($TPL). However, a massive difference between TPL and LB is LB primarily relies on water royalties for their revenues.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down their most recent 1Q25 Earnings: [https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc\\\\_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck\\\\_vF.pdf](https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck_vF.pdf)\\n\\nRevenue came in at $44M, up 131% YoY. 59% came from royalties of land usage. 33% Came from royalties of sales of water/products obtained from land. Only 8% came from royalties from actual Oil & Gas Production. The bulk of these revenues are due to the water needs of high power data centers. As companies continue to develop $10B+ data centers, the access of water is what enables the usage of these centers, creating a continuous revenue opportunity for LB.\\n\\nThe key takeaway is Landbridge does not take on any production/capex risk- it is simply a landowner that allows other companies to operate their production on their assets. This makes it an extremely high margin business, making Visa/Nvidia look inefficient.\\n\\nThe company boasts \"adjusted EBITDA\" margins of 88%. That being said, current GAAP net margins are at 35%, a far cry from the expected 90% management alludes to. This is due to SBC and Interest Expense  due to debt issued to fuel land acquisition. In addition, quarterly FCF is down 40% YoY from $27M to $16M. This is due to a temporary increase in accounts receivable that will be normalized as revenue is recognized.\\n\\nI personally believe that this is palatable for the moment. There is only so much prime attractive land and I would rather LB acquire it now to generate incredible cash flow in the future. For example, the most recent purchase of Bone Ranch for $245M. This led to a 70% QoQ increase in water royalty volumes and will bring in a MINIMUM of $25M per year for the next 5 years. Again, this is all revenue with essentially 90% margins. These are accretive purchases that will payoff tenfold in the coming years.\\n\\nAs Landbridge continues to engage in accretive M&A to accelerate high margin revenue, the thesis continues to strengthen alongside the growth of water intensive data centers.',\n",

I understand that they are risk free and offer liquidity and all that, but why not just go with Tips, at this point with such high inflation (around 8% in 2022) maybe I'm wrong or missing something (probably the other) but isn't it a pretty much a guarantee that over the next 10 years, the average inflation would be over 0,5% and that would make the second more attractive?

       "  'text': 'I don’t think enough people talk about how hard it is to sell when you’re actually up big on a position.\\n\\nEveryone’s always focused on the entry. What’s the next 5x? What are you buying? But honestly, I’ve found the real challenge is knowing what to do once something you own starts ripping.\\n\\nI’ve had this happen a few times now. I’d get in early on something, maybe just messing around with a small position, and then suddenly it’s up 200%, 300%, sometimes more. And I’d love to say I calmly trimmed, locked in profit, and moved on. But that’s not how it went.\\n\\nUsually you start getting emotional. You feel smart. You tell yourself it’s going higher. You start thinking about what your gain could be if you just held a little longer. Sometimes you even add more. I’ve done that. Then it pulls back 40%, and now you’re stuck. Selling feels wrong. Holding feels worse. You just sit there watching it bleed.\\n\\nOne thing that’s helped me is trying to think of selling the same way I think about buying. When a position gets big and my portfolio value starts growing fast, I’ll stop and ask: “If I didn’t own this stock right now, would I be comfortable putting this amount of money into it at this current price and chart?”\\n\\nMost of the time, the answer is no. That’s when I know I probably need to trim. I don’t want one name becoming way too outsized just because I’m emotionally tied to it. Rebalancing feels more like a risk management decision than some emotional call to dump the stock. And honestly, it helps a lot.\\n\\nAnother thing is selling in chunks. I might trim a bit after a double. More if it keeps going. That way I’m locking something in but still giving it room to run. I try not to beat myself up if it goes higher after I sell. That’s just part of the game.\\n\\nI’ve still made plenty of mistakes. I’ve round-tripped some great trades because I got greedy or froze. But I’m starting to learn that having some kind of exit mindset early on makes everything easier. Even just writing down a rough plan or price target helps take the edge off when it comes time to decide.\\n\\nAnyway, just sharing my experience. If you’ve ever held too long, sold too early, or felt stuck on what to do when you’re up big, you’re definitely not the only one. Curious how other people think about this stuff too.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\\n\\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\\n\\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\\n\\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\\n\\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\\n\\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\\n\\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\\n\\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\\n\\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\\n\\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\\n\\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\\n\\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\\n\\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\\n\\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\\n\\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\\n\\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\\n\\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the \"smart money\" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the \"smart money\" is doing, it doesn\\'t look good for the bears.\\n\\nFrom the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%. Additionally, the total number of institutional holders increased 1.75%, from 4020 to 4091. Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions. Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).\\n\\nI don\\'t have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.\\n\\n**Buyers (shares/% increase in overall position):**\\n\\n|Institution|Shares Added|Percent Increase in Position|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Vanguard|3,694,524|1.519%|\\n|Blackrock|3,482,055|1.722%|\\n|Geode Capital Management|2,487,085|4.076%|\\n|JPM\\\\*|3,426,144|9.52%|\\n|Goldman Sachs|14,670,839|123.081%|\\n|Charles Schwab|849,091|4.901%|\\n|Invesco|2,211,300|17.585%|\\n|Nuveen|12,531,327|new|\\n|Citigroup|3,611,937|47.184%|\\n|Deutsche Bank|1,733,531|20.778%|\\n|Assenagon Asset Management|2,978,026|54.277%|\\n|Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group|456,356|5.793%|\\n|Swiss National Bank|26,100|0.321%|\\n|Hsbc Holdings|19,426|0.242%|\\n|National Bank Of Canada\\\\*|5,566,098|307.721%|\\n|Franklin Resources|860|0.013%|\\n|National Pension Service|172,845|3.345%|\\n|Mitsubishi Ufj Asset Management|578,266|12.34%|\\n|Rhumbline Advisers|20,295|0.39%|\\n|Dimensional Fund Advisors|119,500|2.577%|\\n|Wells Fargo|1,176,846|35.262%|\\n|Aberdeen Group|1,729,053|65.228%|\\n\\n*\\\\*JPM analyst has one of the lowest price targets on Tesla and Canada was supposed to be \"mad\" at America.

There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \\\\~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).\\n\\nMy takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don\\'t shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.',\n",

This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today.

       "  'title': 'The eToro IPO- Boom or Doom?',\n",
       "  'text': '[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.\\n\\n**Why am I writing these?**\\n\\nBecause I didn\\'t trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we\\'re getting it today.\\n\\n**What is eToro?**\\n\\neToro is a \"social trading\" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn\\'t exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I\\'m wrong).\\n\\nLaunched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.\\n\\n**Financial Performance**\\n\\n|Year|Net Income|Funded Accounts|EBITDA:|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|||||\\n|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|\\n|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|\\n|2022|\\\\-$21M|2.8M|\\\\-$43M|\\n\\n**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**\\n\\n**Spreads:**\\xa0Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn\\'t rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  \\n**Currency Conversion Fees:**\\xa0Charges on forex trades.  \\n**Interest Income:**\\xa0Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  \\n**Minor Streams:**\\xa0Premium membership fees, minor platform services.\\n\\n**Global User Base**\\n\\nEurope & UK: \\\\~70% of funded accounts.  \\nAsia-Pacific: \\\\~16%.  \\nAmericas (U.S. + Latin America): \\\\~10%.  \\nMiddle East & Africa: \\\\~4%.\\n\\neToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They\\'ve highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\\n\\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n||||||\\n|Funded Accounts|\\\\~3.5M|\\\\~25M|100M+|\\\\~3-5M|\\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\\\~$390M|\\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\\\~breakeven|\\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\\n|Market Cap|\\\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\\\~$55B|\\\\~$65B|\\\\~$6B|\\n\\neToro’s valuation (\\\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we\\'re not opening at a ridiculous price.\\n\\n**Risks:**\\xa0The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and \"Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)\".\\n\\nSo during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease.\\xa0\\n\\nAnother thing to highlight that is a massive risk-\\xa0[eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as\\xa0**principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp)\\xa0This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps.\\xa0**This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nI don\\'t really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its\\' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they\\'re currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we\\'ll see.\\n\\nIf WeBull is any indication, it might be. Overall, will be watching the L2 and the indication prices to see how it goes.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Disclaimer: I am a long-term, mostly passive investor with about $250k in investible assets. I used to trade actively before realizing that a DCA-based passive investing strategy focusing on market and sector ETFs and mutual funds would probably outperform my stock picks. (It has; as it turns out, I'm bad at picking stocks)\\n\\n—\\n\\nI am a lurker who has periodically read this and other personal finance subs for years. I have recently started reading this sub daily because I’m interested in how other people are responding to large market moves provoked by the Trump Administration. While this sub has had rich discussion about bull and bear cases since April 2, it often lacks the introspection I believe is necessary to make consistent, winning portfolio decisions over the long term. Here, I’m going to lay out my observations of this sub and pose some questions you can ask about your portfolio, regardless of your position in the market or political inclination.\\n\\nSince April 2, this sub has been roughly divided into two camps - bears and bulls. Broadly speaking…\\n\\n* Bears believe that the Trump tariffs (specifically) and the chaos caused by the Trump Administration (generally) will tank the market. Bears argue the most deleterious impacts of the Trump tariffs have yet to materialize, economic policy is unstable and therefore unattractive to investors, and consumers are spending less. Nobody knows what Trump will do next - and he is anything but a policy genius.\\n* Bulls believe that the market will continue to bounce back, perhaps even to new all-time highs as the Trump Administration strikes new trade deals. Bulls argue the most damaging tariffs have mostly been paused or rolled back, inflation is under control, and the labor market is healthy. The market always bounces back, and the underlying economy is strong - so what’s with the doom and gloom?\\n\\n(You’ll have to forgive me if I come off as reductive here. I can only do so much to summarize a month and a half of this sub’s output in a few sentences.)\\n\\nThese are both reasonable arguments:\\n\\n* Bears could be correct under many scenarios - e.g., if Trump capriciously decides to reinstate tariffs, especially on China, or if foreign investors flee the US, or if tariffs provoke an inflationary crisis, etc.\\n* Bulls could also be correct under many scenarios - e.g., if Trump really has seen the light, or if businesses have successfully planned for price hikes, or if consumers aren’t fazed by the potential for tariff-induced cost increases, etc.\\n\\nMy point: I would be shocked if I successfully guessed the direction of the economy and made the right portfolio moves to capitalize on it, and you should be shocked if you got it right too.\\n\\nRegardless of your market thesis, I think there are intelligent questions you can ask about your portfolio.\\n\\n* Bears: Suppose, for a moment, the bulls are right. What’s the opportunity cost of holding cash? If the market were to break through all-time highs by the end of May, would I feel bad about buying high? What’s my signal to re-enter the market or substantially reallocate my money to equities? Are there assets that I believe could be recession-proof, or at least recession-resistant, that I’m comfortable with investing in now?\\n* Bulls: Suppose, for a moment, the bears are right. If the market were to suddenly and unexpectedly drop 10% / 15% / 20%, how would my portfolio be impacted? What level of loss am I willing to tolerate? What about sudden changes in the top 3 single-name securities I own? What’s my strategy if the market crashes? Do I have cash to buy at a discount in the event the market drops?\\n\\nAnd I think both camps can benefit from asking themselves: What do I need to believe for my market thesis to be correct? What do I need to believe for the converse to be correct? And do I have a backup strategy if I’m wrong?\\n\\nIn brief, I think this sub can be more humble and less declarative in the way it discusses the markets - which can hopefully result in more nuanced, less charged, and ultimately more profitable discussion.\\n\\n—\\n\\nAs for me, I'm agnostic because I don’t know which way the winds will blow next. I opted to increase my weekly contributions to my brokerage account just after April 2, focusing on small-cap ETFs, on the theory that these would be impacted disproportionately by tariffs and I would therefore buy at a steep discount - even better if the market continued trending downward or traded sideways. The market bounced back much quicker than I thought it would and my portfolio has broken even YTD. I’m a little sad equity prices have recovered so quickly; the best opportunity to buy, in my view, turned out to be fleeting.\\n\\n\",\n",

The market is clearly pricing in massive margin expansion as well as safety due to no tarriff risk and minimal business failure due to their monopolistic power.\\n\\n**Closing Remarks:**\\n\\nI still believe FICO is the closest thing we have to a perfect business. People may believe VantageScore to be a possible disruptor but ultimately, if everyone is using something because they trust their metrics, why risk potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars from poor underwriting to save a few thousand bucks? FICO is still an amazing business, but the multiple leaves little to desire. I have not sold any of my position, nor have I added more given the very rich valuation.',\n",

TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.\\n\\nIn Europe,\\xa0ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%.\\xa0Infineon\\xa0was also sharply higher.\\n\\nSemiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.\\n\\nInvestors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.\\n\\nApple, which still\\xa0makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add\\xa0$900 million to its costs for the current quarter.

       "  'text': 'There are a lot of bull theses on Google discussed on this sub.  However, none of them touches on the biggest reason to buy $GOOG. \\n\\nA post-AGI world is envisioned below:\\n\\n“machines possessing human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task a human can. This could lead to significant societal shifts, including widespread automation of jobs, potentially altering employment structures and requiring new economic models like Universal Basic Income (UBI)”\\n\\nMoving further in time, we may even reach ASI and that’s when Singularity is conjectured to occur. But our focus should be on a post AGI world which we are actually currently heading towards.\\n\\nA post AGI world is very likely to see lost of existing jobs to AI. The counter to this is UBI. However, there is no guarantee UBI will ever occur. This is why investing in $GOOG is highly beneficial to hedge against this possible scenario.\\n\\nIn a post AGI world, there may be many players who are able to provide AGI services. One of the most, if not the most, formidable existing players to gain a significant share of AGI is $GOOG. \\n\\nThere could potentially be trillions of dollars worth of wages replaced by AGI. On top of that, AGI will likely be used to create even more goods and services than before AGI. Meaning, this could easily become a multi trillion dollar industry. \\n\\nNow, if we lose our jobs, and there is no sufficient UBI to raise our living standards, we can at least benefit from a significant increase in our $GOOG investment. \\n\\nThat means it is a good idea to buy $GOOG even if you believe that Google Search will not be redesigned and gets decimated. View that as a hedge against a post AGI world that many are fearing would happen. A type of insurance. \\n\\n$GOOG is definitely one of the best players to invest in for such a scenario. There are just no other public listed companies that can actually go toe to toe against ChatGPT, even the other Mag 7 behemoths. And there are no other companies who has the full stack of technologies required to run a state of the art AI. \\n\\n$GOOG’s value is not just as a good business to own, but also as an insurance against a post AGI world.

       "  'title': 'Impact of US policy on stocks',\n",
       "  'text': \"I've identified 10 economic issues facing the United States that I would like to talk about. Each of these issues reduce economic growth. I would be curious to know what everyone thinks about these issues.\\n\\n1. Tourism - Typically, the US generates ~2 trillion in revenue from tourism per year. Overall, tourism is down around 13% this year. However, tourism from some countries are seeing a sharper drop. For example, Canadian tourism to the US is down around 30%. So far, this is expected to shrink the US economy by ~$200 billion. Additionally, seven commercial airplanes have crashed since Trump took office. Domestic and international travel is down.\\n\\n2. Boycotts - People from other countries are boycotting US products due to their discontentment with the US. This discontent seems to be due to two factors. First, the US is transitioning from a constitutional republic to a totalitarian oligarchy. This is unpopular domestically and abroad. Second, tariffs have impacted foreign economies. For example, German auto workers are being laid off because their cars aren't being sold in the US as much. Canada has seem rising unemployment partially due to the tariffs too. Other countries will be impacted too. Ultimately, I don't know how much boycotting by foreigners will impact the US economy, but it is happening.\\n\\n3. Debt (government, consumer, student) - US treasuries are being sold by foreign countries. This means that the US government must provide a greater return for US treasuries to entice foreign investment. This will reduce government spending because the government will be forced to spend more to repay it's debt.\\n\\nConsumer debt is extremely high too. Consumers owe ~$1.6 trillion on their cars, and ~1.2 trillion on their credit cards. When consumers repay this debt, they are not expanding the economy. Instead, it's just a drain on the economy.\\n\\nThe White House has indicated that ~5 million student loans barrowers will have their wages garnished to repay their student loan debt. The Internet told me the average monthly payment for a student loan is $536/month. I think that seems high. I only pay $192/month. Still, these are barrowers who are unable to repay their student loans. All of their money is going to necessities or servicing debt. Now, they'll have less money to expand the economy.\\n\\n4. Economic uncertainty - US tariff policy has been changing on a daily basis. Investors favor economies that are stable politically and economically. It's impossible to make long-term plans when policy can change on a daily basis. It's no wonder that corporation have been expanding into foreign economies when it's impossible to make a long-term plan due to policy changes. I don't have any numbers on how this could impact the economy, but it should be a drag. US consumers have been more conservative with their spending too amid recession fears.\\n\\n5. Immigration - There are 47.8 million immigrants in the US. That's around 1/7 of the population. ~11 million are undocumented immigrants. ~750 are forcibly removed per day. However, immigrants are voluntarily fleeing the US due to negative sentiment about immigrants and dangers posed by the administration. It's unclear how many are leaving, but there have been worker shortages in meat packing and agriculture which are largely run by undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants payed almost $100 billion in federal taxes last year with around a 8% effective tax rate. That means that they expanded the economy by over a trillion dollars.\\n\\nDocumented immigrants produce more for the economy than undocumented immigrants. Being able to immigrate to another country implies that a person has enough money to do so or that they have a valuable skill. ICE has been removing documented immigrants from the country too. These are people that typically produce more for the economy than the average citizen. Removing members from this group or discouraging others from immigrating to the US is a massive drain on the economy.\\n\\n6. Federal worker firings - Somewhere between 120,000 and 250,000 federal workers have been fired by DOGE. These workers are largely now entering the private sector.\\n\\n7. Transportation sector firings - UPS has fired 20,000 truck drivers. Also, imports have dropped ~1/3. There are around 85,000 longshoremen in the US. They may need to fire 20,000-30,000 in the near future.\\n\\n8. Social security - Social security benefits have not been cut, but it's become harder to receive benefits due to DOGE. Many offices have closed. Phone lines have been cut. And, the social security website has gone down several times. Many seniors and disabled people have been missing their checks and have had little recourse to receive their benefits again. Also, social security will not pay for missed months. If a check is missed for a month, then the individual just needs to try and figure out how to get their check next month. Social security pays ~67 million people each ~$2,000/month (depending on several factors). A missed payment means that a family may need to cut their spending which shrinks the economy.\\n\\n9. Political instability - Everything I've already mentioned is in the realm of politics. The other items I've listed are political, but I imagine I'll get the most push back for this item. The US is undergoing a coup. The administration has disobeyed a SCOTUS order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcias. So far, the White House has refused this order. Constitutional amendments, the right to due process, and birthright citizenship have all entered the sphere of what is considered political. Under the constitution of the US, none of these items are in question. However, the administration is attacking these items and more.\\n\\nCoups can be very bad for business. Protests have been enormous. There's talk of having a general strike. Politically motivated violence is increasing. This directs resources away from expanding the economy.\\n\\n10. Tariffs - A lot can be said about the tariffs. I've mentioned them a few times already. Imports have dropped by around a third. This is likely to be an inflationary pressure on the economy. People may not be able to find the items they want. It's bad bad bad. Real bad. Bad bad.\\n\\nTo be fair, there are some impacts on the economy that increase the value of stocks. For example, de-dollarization means that US goods are cheaper abroad. The dollar has already lost ~15% of its value since the Trump administration.

       "  'text': \"Hello everyone, I initially invested in NVIDIA back in January when it dropped to $123, so my average cost is quite high at that price. Currently, I’m seeing a loss of about 6%. I'm considering whether I should sell NVIDIA for a profit when it rebounds and switch my investment to Google, which seems quite affordable at the moment. Since my average with NVIDIA is high, I’m not entirely comfortable holding onto it. If I switch to Google, my average would be much more lower. Do you think this is a wise move? I understand we can’t predict the future, but in your opinion, which of these stocks is likely to yield better returns over the next five years?\",\n",

       "  'text': 'From Bloomberg: US consumer prices probably picked up in April after the smallest advance in nine months, foreshadowing a broader acceleration as many companies seek to pass on higher tariffs.\\n\\nA closely watched gauge of prices paid by Americans for goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy costs, is forecast to have risen 0.3%, based on a Bloomberg survey of economists. In March, the so-called core consumer price index inched up just 0.1%. \\n\\nWhile Tuesday’s report is likely to show limited pass-through so far of higher US duties on imported goods, many economists anticipate the impact becoming more pronounced over time.\\n\\nThat helps explains growing apprehension among consumers about inflation specifically and the economy and job market more broadly. Retail sales due Thursday are expected to show some of that anxiety; after a healthy 1.5% jump at the end of the first quarter, economists forecast little change in April sales as front-loaded demand for motor vehicles cooled.\\n\\nFor their part, companies are threading the needle between attempting to mitigate the costs of tariffs through price hikes, and trying to guard against a drop in sales as consumers recoil from sticker shock. \\n\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-10/us-inflation-starting-to-stir-as-trump-tariff-threat-looms',\n",

And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...

Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. \\n\\nI remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...\\n\\n I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.\\n\\nThen it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, \"don\\'t understand palantir it\\'s just AI hype vapourware\" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it.

This policy aims to \"align\" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I\\'m Interested in MRK, we\\'re already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).\\n\\n[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\\\\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids.

       "  'text': 'From the outset I want to be very clear, I have a brokerage account and a retirement account. The retirement account continues to fed regularly and stays invested always. When I hold cash it allows me to max my 401k whereas normally I might go as low as half max.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo around end of January/early February I started selling some positions as well as covered calls and beefing up my cash positions. I did this because of the moves of the current administration impacted my view of the U.S. equity market security and U.S. economic as a whole. When April tariff liberation day or whatever happened I used that cash position to buy. To be clear, I did NOT time these market movies perfectly. While I ended up selling close to the top, I redeployed heavily in 4/10 and 4/11, the two biggest drop days, which wasn’t ideal, but also certainly was not something I regretted. Today, on this rally I sold more covered calls (and my April buys) and exited a couple smaller positions I picked up in April. \\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t want to insert anything political, however the reality is that there investing is based off of faith in the market, and in this case my market faith is heavily shaped by the actions of the current administration. With that said I am only considering politics in terms of how I see it impacting the market, and the economy (separate but related things). \\n\\n\\n\\nThe current administration has made the market volatile. As politically agnostic as I can possibly be I think that is simply a true statement. Volatility can allow for serious money to be made, it can also introduce increased risk. Everyone has to balance their risk tolerance and their investing goals to determine the appropriate strategy for them, it is not a one size fits all model. \\n\\n\\n\\nMy situation is I have sizable (in my mind) taxable brokerage and retirement accounts. I own a home. I am married and both my wife and I work and earn solid salaries for the area, but it is a VHCOL area. We do not have kids currently but would like to have one. We are mid 30s. \\n\\n\\n\\nMy goal is not just to maximize my portfolio gains but also to protect the capital in my taxable brokerage. No matter what my wife and I contribute to our retirement accounts. Having more cash on hand allows for higher/maximum contributions. \\n\\n\\n\\nGiven all of that context, I have found a temporary but attractive strategy for my risk tolerance/goals. I currently have built up my cash position so it’s is just about the same as my taxable brokerage balance. After redeploying some cash in April on the big drops, today I either sold those positions or sold covered calls in them. The cash I am now holding in my brokerage (all other cash is in a HYSA), is there to be redeployed on market drops. The covered call positions I sold have strike prices between 30-50% increase from current trading price, and all positions I sold covered calls on are currently positive. \\n\\n\\n\\nI used this same strategy when I sold in January/february. It allows me to lock in gains and build cash that can be redeployed at the cost of limiting upside. Since I see this as an extremely volatile market with an uncertain trajectory over the next few years, I am happy to trade limited upside for guaranteed gain. All stocks I buy are otherwise positions I would want to hold long anyway, in case shares are not called/go down in value. I also will buy back the CC itself if opportunity arises (I did this in April for some of the CCs I sold earlier in the year). \\n\\n\\n\\nI made a similar post in January/February when I did this and got a good amount of negativity. I thought I would share an update and offer much more context. \\n\\n\\n\\nI am not encouraging anyone to use my strategy or take any departure from their own investing strategy. As I said, everyone has a very unique risk tolerance/investing goal formula and there is no one size fits all. Just wanted to share with the community \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: \"We don\\'t see that happening.\" \"We believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,\" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: \"I think they\\'re saying that just to negotiate deals with me.\"\\n\\n> Trump\\'s remark on Mattel \"trying to go somewhere else,\" and the resulting threat of a targeted, 100 percent tariff on its toys was somewhat ambiguous, given the company has only advocated shifting more of its manufacturing outside of China.',\n",

       "  'text': 'CrowdStrike, a leading name in cybersecurity, saw its stock tumble this week following reports of a federal investigation into a major government contract. The probe centers around a $32 million software deal tied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), sparking investor concerns about the company’s business practices and future government partnerships.\\n\\nAccording to sources close to the matter, the Department of the Treasury’s inspector general is investigating the role\\xa0[CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)\\xa0played in a procurement process that allegedly skipped competitive bidding rules. The deal was executed through Carahsoft, a major government IT contractor, and involved CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software being fast-tracked into IRS systems.\\n\\nThe issue? Investigators are trying to determine if the deal improperly bypassed\\xa0[federal acquisition regulations](https://www.acquisition.gov/), which require fair competition for most government contracts. So far, no formal accusations have been made, but the existence of an active investigation is enough to rattle stakeholders.\\n\\nOnce news of the probe broke, CrowdStrike’s stock dropped by nearly 5% in intraday trading. The sharp decline reflects investor anxiety over potential reputational damage, contract delays, or future revenue losses tied to government scrutiny.\\n\\nThis development comes at a time when CrowdStrike is viewed as a major player in protecting public and private institutions from cyber threats. Any disruption to that perception could shift market dynamics in favor of competitors.\\n\\n# What This Means for the Cybersecurity Industry\\n\\nGovernment contracts are a huge revenue source for cybersecurity firms. But as this situation highlights, they can also come with regulatory risks. The scrutiny CrowdStrike now faces serves as a warning to other tech firms: follow proper procurement procedures, or face financial and legal consequences.\\n\\nAnalysts say this probe might not spell long-term doom for CrowdStrike, especially if no wrongdoing is ultimately found. Still, it’s a reminder that trust and transparency are as critical as innovation in today’s tech-driven economy.',\n",

Trump also urged China to open its markets to U.S. products, emphasizing that \"closed markets don\\'t work anymore.\"\\n\\n[Full Article Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/09/trump-china-tariffs-trade-talks.html)\\n\\nWhat do we actually think the result of this is going to be?

This **leaves approximately 10% EBITDA** for a well-run retail company.\\n\\nNow, even if you take the best-case scenario—**a 10% tariff on all imports** (which is what even the UK has after its \"historic\" deal with the US)—that 45% cost becomes **49.5%** (**45 × 1.1**), reducing retail companies’ EBITDA to approximately  under **6%**.\\n\\nHowever, not all retail companies in the US are healthy—**many are on the brink of bankruptcy with average EBITDA under 7%**. Even Walmart, a volume-driven company and considered one of the healthiest low-cost retailers in the world, has an EBITDA of approximately **6%**. \\n\\nAnd now, **who still thinks we aren\\'t headed for a recession in Q2 and Q3?** When do you think orders are placed for Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas? **Six months in advance.** And here we are, holding all orders or even if placing orders now with goods sitting in Chinese warehouses instead of being **in transit** as they should be.\\n\\nYou will not only see **fewer products on shelves**, but also **reduced consumer spending and layoffs**.

       "  'text': 'There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.\\n\\nData analytics software vendor\\xa0Palantir\\xa0jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of\\xa0Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants\\xa0Cisco\\xa0and\\xa0IBM\\xa0earlier this year.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\xa0tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by\\xa0Apple\\xa0and\\xa0Nvidia.\\n\\nPalantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top\\xa0S&P 500\\xa0performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.\\n\\nThe Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.\\n\\nPalantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has\\xa0benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build\\xa0artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.\\n\\nIn an aminated\\xa0shareholder letter\\xa0attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”\\n\\n“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.\\n\\nBut investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit.\\xa0Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.\\n\\nThat all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.\\n\\n“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.\\n\\nAmong the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because\\xa0Broadcom\\xa0and\\xa0Tesla\\xa0are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.\\n\\nPalantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following\\xa0first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a\\xa0deceleration in international commercial sales\\xa0that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.\\n\\n“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”\\n\\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/palantir-joins-top-10-most-valuable-tech-companies-stock-at-premium.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/palantir-joins-top-10-most-valuable-tech-companies-stock-at-premium.html)',\n",

       "  'text': 'We\\'ve all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they\\'re super undervalued or how they\\'re the next Kodak. \\n\\nI\\'m interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let\\'s see some details though, not just \"Waymo is really cool so it\\'s worth a trillion dollars.\" Let\\'s see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF\\'s, etc... \\n\\nI\\'d love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! \\n\\nEdit: I\\'ll start with mine. \\n\\nSearch- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let\\'s say search is worth around 800B.\\n\\nYouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I\\'m hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let\\'s just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.\\n\\nCloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it\\'s difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let\\'s assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. \\n\\nGoogle networks- shrinking business that\\'s significantly less profitable than search, so we\\'ll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I\\'d say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.\\n\\nOther -We\\'ll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It\\'s extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let\\'s be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?\\n\\nBalance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let\\'s be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we\\'ll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? \\n\\nSo, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you\\'d still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time. ',\n",

Nintendo on Thursday said it sold 10.8 million units of the Switch in the year, just shy of its own forecast and down 31% year-on-year.\\n\\nMarket research firm Omdia expects Nintendo to sell 14.7 million Switch 2 units in 2025 alone, which would be about 10% ahead of the original Switch’s debut year.\\n\\n“Switch 2 will launch into a stronger position than its predecessor, with over 100 million active Switch users providing a strong foundation for adoption,” George Jijiashvili, Omdia’s senior principal analyst, told CNBC by email.\\n\\n# Tariffs in focus\\n\\nInvestors are also focused on Nintendo’s forecast for the fiscal year. The company expects net sales of 1.9 trillion yen, a 63% year-on-year rise but just short of LSEG estimates of 2 trillion yen. It expects net profit to jump 7.6% to 300 billion yen, below LSEG estimates of 388.8 billion yen.\\n\\nHowever, Nintendo noted that all of its forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective Apr. 10 — following a\\xa0pause\\xa0in U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs for many countries.\\n\\nNintendo in April\\xa0delayed pre-orders\\xa0for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. Nintendo’s consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, which faces duties of 46% once the pause lifts.\\n\\nNintendo’s President Shuntaro Furukawa said on Thursday that if additional tariffs are imposed and prices of its goods need to be adjusted, demand in the U.S. may decrease, Reuters reported. Duties could hit profit to the tune of tens of billions of yen, Furukawa added, according to the report.\\n\\nSerkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games, said Nintendo’s forecasts are typically conservative.\\n\\n“Nintendo loves lowballing their forecasts, and the current climate around tariffs gives them all the reason to be more cautious than ever,” Toto told CNBC.\\n\\nHe added that tariffs are creating an “unclear future” for Nintendo, making it “impossible” for any hardware maker to make sales predictions.\\n\\n“What happens if the tariffs on imports from China stay this high for longer or if they are raised for Vietnam?” Toto said.\\n\\n“If Nintendo needed to raise prices by $100 or more, all bets would be off and the company would be under enormous pressure in the all important U.S. market.”\\n\\n# Switch 2 fuels stock rally\\n\\nInvestors are now focused on how the successor to the console, the Switch 2, will perform following its launch. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and has\\xa0improved features\\xa0compared with its predecessor.\\n\\nAs well as the 15 million unit sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, Nintendo said it expects to sell 45 million units of software during the same period.\\n\\nGames are important for the success of any console and Nintendo said the Switch 2 will launch with two titles — “Mario Kart World” and “Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour.” There will also be Switch 2 versions of existing games such as “Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Nintendo is leaning on its popular characters such as Mario and Zelda to boost the appeal of the Switch 2.\\n\\nNintendo first launched the original Switch in 2017 and it has become the Japanese gaming giant’s second-best-selling console ever with over 150 million units sold. The firm managed to\\xa0extend the life of the hardware\\xa0thanks to hit games involving characters like Super Mario, franchises such as Pokemon and the expansion of its\\xa0intellectual property into films.\\n\\nInvestors are hopeful the company can continue to ride its wave of popularity with shares up around 30% this year and 64% over the past 12 months.\\n\\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/nintendo-forecasts-sales-of-15-million-units-for-switch-2-console.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/nintendo-forecasts-sales-of-15-million-units-for-switch-2-console.html)',\n",

The company\\'s marquee release for the period, Bong Joon Ho\\'s sci-fi dark comedy \"Mickey 17,\" earned only slightly more than its reported budget at the box office.\\nThat meant studios revenue fell 18% to $2.31 billion, missing estimates of $2.73 billion, according to Visible Alpha.\\nThe company has, however, made a strong start to the second quarter with Ryan Coogler\\'s horror film \"Sinners\" and the blockbuster \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which has raked in around $900 million globally, making it the biggest release of 2025 so far. Its summer lineup also looks strong with \"Superman,\" directed by Marvel\\'s long-time hitmaker James Gunn, set to release in July.\\nRevenue at the TV networks segment, which includes CNN, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, fell 7%, with advertising revenue in the business declining 12% as marketers avoided cable TV amid cord-cutting by subscribers.\\nOverall, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of 2025 to $8.98 billion, missing analysts\\' average estimate of $9.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Loss of 18 cents per share was also larger than expectations for a 13-cent loss, even as costs declined 11.8%.\\nThe company\\'s shares were down 1.9% in premarket trading.\\nStill, its streaming business was a bright spot.\\nWBD added 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, compared with 3.1 million estimated by analysts, according to Visible Alpha, taking its total to 122.3 million. The quarter featured some strong content slate including the third season of HBO\\'s \"The White Lotus\" and the medical drama series \"The Pitt\".\\nThe company also launched its Max streaming service in Australia earlier this year, following rollouts in more than 70 countries across Europe and Asia last year. Analysts say it has also benefited and reduced churn thanks to a streaming bundle combining Disney+, Hulu and Max that was introduced last year.\\nReporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta',\n",

For background they offer personalized telehealth services and offer medications for hair loss, sexual health and weight loss through GLP-1s.\\n\\nThe problem I see is their Moat. They have to spend lots of money on advertising to attract customers due to competition such as Ro. Customer acquisition costs is high but customer switching costs is minimal. There are probably dozens of other telehealth provider competing for the same product offerings. They sell generic drugs that a thousand other pharmacies make. Overall it's very similar to Netflix which takes other peoples products and places them in a glamorous digital online platform. They do not make drugs 💊 and thus have no competitive advantage from patents or IP. \\n\\n\\n\\nTheir compounded glp business is controversial and rightfully so given that they are profiting off billions of dollars spent for R&D from Lilly and Novo. It is a recipe for litigation. The only reason Novo partnered with Hims is due to most of the margins going to them (I assume so, otherwise it makes no sense). The only way I see HIMS becoming successful is actually delivering perfect, frictionless services as smooth as Amazon prime. But then again, who says other companies including Novo and Lly do not replicate this model and sell their newest GLP-1s exclusively through this platform, thus shrinking margins further from HIMs. Can anyone point to whether the recent rally is justified and if it is worth 50 billion in market cap? \",\n",

         "Tesla limits investors' ability to sue over breach of fiduciary duties",
         "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion.

         "Tesla limits investors' ability to sue over breach of fiduciary duties. In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty.

         "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a significant shift in the central bank’s monetary policy framework, acknowledging that the current strategy, established in 2020, may no longer be adequate in addressing the evolving economic landscape marked by persistent supply shocks and heightened inflation volatility. ￼\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\t* Reassessment of Monetary Policy Framework: Powell announced that the Fed is reevaluating its approach to monetary policy, particularly the average inflation targeting strategy adopted in 2020. This strategy allowed for inflation to exceed the 2% target temporarily to compensate for previous shortfalls. However, the unforeseen surge in inflation post-pandemic has rendered this approach less effective.  ￼\n\n\t* Emergence of Persistent Supply Shocks: The economy is facing more frequent and potentially enduring supply shocks, such as those stemming from tariffs, pandemics, and severe weather events. These shocks pose a dual challenge by simultaneously driving up prices and hindering economic growth, complicating the Fed’s policy decisions.  ￼\n\n\t* Shift Towards Inflation Control: In light of these challenges, Powell indicated a strategic pivot back to prioritizing inflation control. The Fed aims to develop a policy framework that is robust across various economic conditions, ensuring preparedness for potential downturns while maintaining its commitment to a 2% inflation target.  ￼\n\n\t* Implications for Interest Rates: While Powell did not provide specific guidance on immediate interest rate adjustments, the acknowledgment of higher real interest rates and the potential for more volatile inflation suggests that the Fed may maintain elevated rates for an extended period to anchor inflation expectations.\n\nThe Fed plans to unveil the revised policy framework between August and September 2025, aiming to enhance its resilience to unforeseen economic developments while upholding its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  ￼",

         "# Key Takeaways\n\n* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.\n* The combination will benefit customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\n* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n\n**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA** – Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1) based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.\n\n“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.” \n\nThe Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”\n\n“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”\n\n# Structure and Timing \n\nIn the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on: \n\n* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and\n* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.\n\nAs consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:\n\n*  $4 billion in cash,\n* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and\n* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. \n\nBased on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. \n\nWithin a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. \n\n# Governance \n\nFollowing the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. \n\nIt is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. \n\nUpon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. \n\n# Community Leadership \n\nThe Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges. \n\n# Strategic and Customer Objectives \n\nFollowing the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans. \n\nThe new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments. Charter customers will benefit from Cox Business’ well-known industry leadership in business telecommunications, including Segra and RapidScale. \n\nCharter and Cox employees will benefit from investments in employee-focused technology and AI tools and an expansion of Charter’s self-progression career advancement model for promotions and standardized pay increases. \n\n# Specific Benefits From the Combination Include: \n\n* The combined company will bring together the best products and practices of each company to benefit all of the combined company’s customers and employees.\n* The combined company will be better positioned to aggressively compete in an expanding and dynamic marketplace that includes:\n   * Larger, national broadband companies with wireline and wireless capabilities,\n   * Regional wireline and mobile competitors,\n   * Global video distribution providers and platforms, and satellite broadband companies.\n* The combined company also will be better positioned for continued and expanded investment and innovation:\n   * In mobile, given the increased footprint;\n   * In video, where Big Tech currently leverages global scale in content and distribution;\n   * In advertising, where the transaction will expand opportunities for advertisers large and small, national, regional, and local, bringing new competition in an area now dominated by Big Tech;\n   * In the business sector, where the combined company will have additional coverage, yet still remain a regional player competing against larger, national competitors;\n   * And through greater product innovation in areas including AI tools and small cell deployment of licensed, shared licensed and unlicensed spectrum, bringing new and advanced services and capabilities to consumers and businesses.\n* Cox customers will gain access to Charter’s simple and transparent pricing and packaging structure, including no annual contracts for any residential services, which means customers are free to change service providers at any time, with no risk of early termination fees.\n* Cox customers also will benefit from Charter’s industry-first Customer Service Commitments, which include:\n   * Charter’s 100% U.S.-based customer service team available 24/7.\n   * Charter has committed to fixing service disruptions quickly, including same-day technician dispatch when requested before 5:00 pm; if not, the next day.\n   * Charter provides customers credits for outages that last longer than two hours.\n* This proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n   * The combined company will adopt Charter’s sales and service workforce model, which will fully return Cox’s customer service function to the U.S.\n   * ­All employees will earn a starting wage of *at least* $20 per hour and will gain access to Charter’s industry-leading benefits, which include:\n      * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees; Charter has absorbed the full premium cost increase for the last 12 years.\n      * Market-leading retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with a company match up to 6% of their eligible pay, with an additional 3% contribution available for most employees.\n      * Free or discounted Spectrum Mobile, TV and Internet service.\n      * Multiple opportunities for upward advancement and to build careers, including through tuition-free undergraduate degree and certificate programs via flexible online learning; self-progression programs with standardized pay raises, and formal development programs, such as the Broadband Field Technician Apprenticeship program.\n      * Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides frontline employees the ability to purchase stock and receive a matching grant of Charter Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) up to 1 for 1 based on years of service, offering employees another meaningful incentive to grow their careers with Charter.\n* The combined company will expand Charter’s award-winning local Spectrum News stations in the Cox footprint, bringing hyper-local, unbiased news coverage to more communities. The combined company will not own any national programming,\n* The combined company will retain its industry leadership in protecting the security of U.S. communications networks from foreign threats. \n\n# Financial Outlook \n\nBy deploying Charter’s operating strategy across Cox’s footprint, the combined company will: \n\n* Offer Cox customers the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans,\n* Invest in more U.S.-based employees,\n* Continually improve service quality,\n* And support the development of third-party platforms for new consumer products through continuing network evolution. \n\nDespite those investments, the combined business is expected to produce higher cash flow per passing and investment returns over time by creating and preserving more relationships on a fixed network, selling more products to each customer, and reducing operating and capital costs per passing by lowering service transactions, churn and fixed cost leverage.  \n\nCharter also currently expects approximately $500 million of annualized cost synergies achieved within three years of close – stemming from typical procurement and overhead savings. \n\n  \nLink: [https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies](https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies)",

         "Charter Communications and Cox Communications Announce Definitive Agreement to Combine Companies. # Key Takeaways\n\n* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.\n* The combination will benefit customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\n* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n\n**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA** – Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1) based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.\n\n“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.” \n\nThe Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”\n\n“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”\n\n# Structure and Timing \n\nIn the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on: \n\n* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and\n* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.\n\nAs consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:\n\n*  $4 billion in cash,\n* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and\n* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. \n\nBased on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. \n\nWithin a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. \n\n# Governance \n\nFollowing the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. \n\nIt is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. \n\nUpon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. \n\n# Community Leadership \n\nThe Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership.

         "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html\n\n\n> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \n\n> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.\n\n> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\n\n- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected\n\n> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.\n\n> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.\n\n> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",

         "Why Tesla is another Enron - How can a company with a valuation equal to the world's seven largest automakers Earnings Catch-up",
         "So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla's current valuation is equal to the sum of the world's seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face \"Earnings Catch-up\", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla's sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla's main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?\n\nIn my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.\n\nMy teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called \"Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room\".\n\nTherefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past.

         "Why Tesla is another Enron - How can a company with a valuation equal to the world's seven largest automakers Earnings Catch-up. So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla's current valuation is equal to the sum of the world's seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face \"Earnings Catch-up\", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla's sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla's main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?\n\nIn my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.\n\nMy teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called \"Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room\".\n\nTherefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past. Beliefs and slogans are like the horn of the technological paradise, gathering a large number of irrational investors.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of pure finance and financial market technical theory, the financial pressure that Tesla needs to fulfill in 2026 is so great that it is suffocating, or even desperate.

         "UnitedHealth Stock (UNH) Continues to Suffer from Donald Trump's Executive Order Do You Think It Will Rise Next?",
         "UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments. Rising medical costs, an unexpected CEO departure, and heightened regulatory uncertainty stemming from former President Trump’s recent executive order on drug pricing have all contributed to investor unease.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the stock may appear attractively valued following its sharp decline, caution is warranted. The current environment remains highly uncertain, and further downside risks could materialize in the near term. As a result, I am bearish on UNH.\n\n\n\nRising Medical Costs Rattle Nerves\n\nUNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization.

         "UnitedHealth Stock (UNH) Continues to Suffer from Donald Trump's Executive Order Do You Think It Will Rise Next?. UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments. Rising medical costs, an unexpected CEO departure, and heightened regulatory uncertainty stemming from former President Trump’s recent executive order on drug pricing have all contributed to investor unease.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the stock may appear attractively valued following its sharp decline, caution is warranted. The current environment remains highly uncertain, and further downside risks could materialize in the near term. As a result, I am bearish on UNH.\n\n\n\nRising Medical Costs Rattle Nerves\n\nUNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization. Since then, investors have naturally kept dumping shares as faith in UNH’s cost management faltered.\n\n\n\nCEO Exit Sparks Leadership Crisis\n\nAs the dust was settling, UNH dropped a bombshell: CEO Andrew Witty resigned abruptly two days ago for “personal reasons,” and the company withdrew its prior full-year outlook.

         "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/tariffs-walmart-prices-nightcap\n\nYou may be thinking, “Whatever, I went to Walmart/Target/Home Depot this week and everything was fine.” And that’s probably true, because retailers across the board stockpiled as much as they could to get ahead of Trump’s April 2 tariff rollout. But as those inventories wind down, the more-expensive goods ordered after April 2 will hit the shelves. (For Walmart, that’s expected to happen next month.)\n\nBusinesses are already absorbing the costs, according to the latest gauge of US wholesale inflation, known as the Producer Price Index. Last month, wholesale prices actually fell, which sounds like a good thing until you look a little closer at why.\n\nThe dip in the PPI came from a plunge in “trade services,” a category that measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. Essentially, that means producers are letting higher input costs eat into their profit margins while they try to figure out what to do.\n\nConsumers are pulling back even more than economists expected.

         "There’s no denying it now: Tariffs are raising prices. https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/tariffs-walmart-prices-nightcap\n\nYou may be thinking, “Whatever, I went to Walmart/Target/Home Depot this week and everything was fine.” And that’s probably true, because retailers across the board stockpiled as much as they could to get ahead of Trump’s April 2 tariff rollout. But as those inventories wind down, the more-expensive goods ordered after April 2 will hit the shelves. (For Walmart, that’s expected to happen next month.)\n\nBusinesses are already absorbing the costs, according to the latest gauge of US wholesale inflation, known as the Producer Price Index. Last month, wholesale prices actually fell, which sounds like a good thing until you look a little closer at why.\n\nThe dip in the PPI came from a plunge in “trade services,” a category that measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. Essentially, that means producers are letting higher input costs eat into their profit margins while they try to figure out what to do.\n\nConsumers are pulling back even more than economists expected. Consumer spending data for April was just barely positive year-over-year, rising 0.1%.\n\nTo be sure, there are some areas where prices are actually going down.

         "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

         "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a significant shift in the central bank’s monetary policy framework, acknowledging that the current strategy, established in 2020, may no longer be adequate in addressing the evolving economic landscape marked by persistent supply shocks and heightened inflation volatility. ￼\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\t* Reassessment of Monetary Policy Framework: Powell announced that the Fed is reevaluating its approach to monetary policy, particularly the average inflation targeting strategy adopted in 2020. This strategy allowed for inflation to exceed the 2% target temporarily to compensate for previous shortfalls. However, the unforeseen surge in inflation post-pandemic has rendered this approach less effective.  ￼\n\n\t* Emergence of Persistent Supply Shocks: The economy is facing more frequent and potentially enduring supply shocks, such as those stemming from tariffs, pandemics, and severe weather events. These shocks pose a dual challenge by simultaneously driving up prices and hindering economic growth, complicating the Fed’s policy decisions.  ￼\n\n\t* Shift Towards Inflation Control: In light of these challenges, Powell indicated a strategic pivot back to prioritizing inflation control. The Fed aims to develop a policy framework that is robust across various economic conditions, ensuring preparedness for potential downturns while maintaining its commitment to a 2% inflation target.  ￼\n\n\t* Implications for Interest Rates: While Powell did not provide specific guidance on immediate interest rate adjustments, the acknowledgment of higher real interest rates and the potential for more volatile inflation suggests that the Fed may maintain elevated rates for an extended period to anchor inflation expectations.\n\nThe Fed plans to unveil the revised policy framework between August and September 2025, aiming to enhance its resilience to unforeseen economic developments while upholding its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  ￼",

         "UNH is the most interesting stock today.\n\nHi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Says US to Set Tariff Rates for Other Nations in Weeks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-16/trump-says-us-will-set-tariff-rates-for-other-nations-in-weeks)\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Shares of UNH fell nearly 13% following reports of a DOJ criminal investigation into potential Medicare fraud. The company stated it was unaware of any such probe. Loved this stock trading wise yesterday- premarket we had a \"rebuttal\" of UNH saying they weren't aware of any DOJ investigation, so we saw the stock spike up 10 points and then fall back, sell off, then hit \\~$250 at the low. I think UNH is ridiculously cheap at this price, and even with a DOJ investigation I believe that losing close to $50B in market cap is unjustified. \n\nManaged to snipe the low, currently long and thinking of merging into long-term holdings. Even with triple the damages (standard in this case), damages are \\~$5B from my research.

         "(05/16) Interesting Stocks Today - Medical Madness and Mergers. UNH is the most interesting stock today.\n\nHi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Says US to Set Tariff Rates for Other Nations in Weeks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-16/trump-says-us-will-set-tariff-rates-for-other-nations-in-weeks)\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Shares of UNH fell nearly 13% following reports of a DOJ criminal investigation into potential Medicare fraud. The company stated it was unaware of any such probe. Loved this stock trading wise yesterday- premarket we had a \"rebuttal\" of UNH saying they weren't aware of any DOJ investigation, so we saw the stock spike up 10 points and then fall back, sell off, then hit \\~$250 at the low. I think UNH is ridiculously cheap at this price, and even with a DOJ investigation I believe that losing close to $50B in market cap is unjustified. \n\nManaged to snipe the low, currently long and thinking of merging into long-term holdings. Even with triple the damages (standard in this case), damages are \\~$5B from my research. I believe UNH is essentially \"too big to fail\" in the healthcare sector as well, and possible exclusion from Medicare is essentially shooting ACA in the face at this point and screwing over millions of people. Other than that, I have a low enough price to not be too concerned.\n\n[**CHTR (Charter)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CHTR&p=d)\\-CHTR announced a $34.5B merger with Cox Communications, combining their broadband and mobile services to compete with streaming/wireless.

I’m pretty new and I’ve never had any advice besides put your money in an index fund and forget but my separate 401k is already like that so I wanted to have something I can manage more directly.  I just want some guidance as my objective is slow growth but slightly beating the s&p 500 each year. \n\nMy strategy is I have 25 stocks that I think are good long term holds as I kind of want to create my own index fund with stocks I like. Then I have 5 index funds I currently own which are VTI VB VFC VGT and QQQ which I do not plan on selling but my positions are individually worth the same as the stocks in my portfolio. \n\nThe way I buy stocks is I cannot buy less than the minimum share I currently own. For example if I currently own 1.1 share of a random stock in my portfolio, that is my baseline and I have to buy more than that share for any stock I choose to buy. However I try not to go way above that minimum amount I set for myself.

One sell and one buy as this is not to overthink my positions but at the same time giving myself a chance to adapt to market situations each month. \n\n\n\n\nOverall this strategy has beaten the s&p 500 comfortably last year and this year but I would like to see what you guys think cause I’m no genius and in fact I’m quite the opposite and probably can be doing something much better. \n\nI would also like to slowly deposit more money into my portfolio but I’m currently broke and all of my money is going into rent and living expenses so the money I saved up in college is the money that I have to work with right now",

The United States has completely lost any morality.\n\nAlthough the United States is indeed a country where everything is about money and whoever has money is the king, I also see that the strong Delaware judges are trying to maintain the final decency of the judiciary to give social fairness.\n\nCompared to the SEC, which weakly sued Musk and was even broken by Musk, the Delaware judge is the last and best shield of the United States.\n\nThe SEC is a regulatory unit that lacks even the most basic dignity and is far weaker than China's Securities Regulatory Commission.",

         "> Coinbase on Thursday reported that cyber criminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data to use in social engineering attacks. The incident may cost Coinbase up to $400 million to fix, the company estimated. The crypto exchange operator received an email on May 11 from someone claiming they obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts as well as other internal Coinbase documentation, including materials relating to customer-service and account-management systems, Coinbase reported in an SEC filing. Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, affected data included sensitive data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and emails; masked bank account numbers and identifiers as well as the last four digits of social security numbers; government ID images and account balances, the company said.\n\n> “Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks,” the company said in a blog post. “These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker.” Coinbase had detected the breach independently in previous months, per the filing. It immediately terminated the employees involved, warned customers whose information may have been accessed and enhanced its fraud monitoring protections.\n\n> The threat actor paid overseas contractors and employees in support rolls to obtain the information, it said. “We’re cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received,” the company said in the blog. “Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.” Coinbase operates the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. In that past week it announced an acquisition that is expected to help it expand its global reach and gained entry to the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which will take effect next week.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-hackers-bribed-staff-to-steal-customer-data-and-are-demanding-20-million-ransom.html",

         "# Key Takeaways\n\n* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.\n* The combination will benefit customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\n* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n\n**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA** – Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1) based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.\n\n“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.” \n\nThe Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”\n\n“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”\n\n# Structure and Timing \n\nIn the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on: \n\n* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and\n* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.\n\nAs consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:\n\n*  $4 billion in cash,\n* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and\n* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. \n\nBased on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. \n\nWithin a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. \n\n# Governance \n\nFollowing the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. \n\nIt is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. \n\nUpon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. \n\n# Community Leadership \n\nThe Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges. \n\n# Strategic and Customer Objectives \n\nFollowing the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans. \n\nThe new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments. Charter customers will benefit from Cox Business’ well-known industry leadership in business telecommunications, including Segra and RapidScale. \n\nCharter and Cox employees will benefit from investments in employee-focused technology and AI tools and an expansion of Charter’s self-progression career advancement model for promotions and standardized pay increases. \n\n# Specific Benefits From the Combination Include: \n\n* The combined company will bring together the best products and practices of each company to benefit all of the combined company’s customers and employees.\n* The combined company will be better positioned to aggressively compete in an expanding and dynamic marketplace that includes:\n   * Larger, national broadband companies with wireline and wireless capabilities,\n   * Regional wireline and mobile competitors,\n   * Global video distribution providers and platforms, and satellite broadband companies.\n* The combined company also will be better positioned for continued and expanded investment and innovation:\n   * In mobile, given the increased footprint;\n   * In video, where Big Tech currently leverages global scale in content and distribution;\n   * In advertising, where the transaction will expand opportunities for advertisers large and small, national, regional, and local, bringing new competition in an area now dominated by Big Tech;\n   * In the business sector, where the combined company will have additional coverage, yet still remain a regional player competing against larger, national competitors;\n   * And through greater product innovation in areas including AI tools and small cell deployment of licensed, shared licensed and unlicensed spectrum, bringing new and advanced services and capabilities to consumers and businesses.\n* Cox customers will gain access to Charter’s simple and transparent pricing and packaging structure, including no annual contracts for any residential services, which means customers are free to change service providers at any time, with no risk of early termination fees.\n* Cox customers also will benefit from Charter’s industry-first Customer Service Commitments, which include:\n   * Charter’s 100% U.S.-based customer service team available 24/7.\n   * Charter has committed to fixing service disruptions quickly, including same-day technician dispatch when requested before 5:00 pm; if not, the next day.\n   * Charter provides customers credits for outages that last longer than two hours.\n* This proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n   * The combined company will adopt Charter’s sales and service workforce model, which will fully return Cox’s customer service function to the U.S.\n   * ­All employees will earn a starting wage of *at least* $20 per hour and will gain access to Charter’s industry-leading benefits, which include:\n      * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees; Charter has absorbed the full premium cost increase for the last 12 years.\n      * Market-leading retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with a company match up to 6% of their eligible pay, with an additional 3% contribution available for most employees.\n      * Free or discounted Spectrum Mobile, TV and Internet service.\n      * Multiple opportunities for upward advancement and to build careers, including through tuition-free undergraduate degree and certificate programs via flexible online learning; self-progression programs with standardized pay raises, and formal development programs, such as the Broadband Field Technician Apprenticeship program.\n      * Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides frontline employees the ability to purchase stock and receive a matching grant of Charter Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) up to 1 for 1 based on years of service, offering employees another meaningful incentive to grow their careers with Charter.\n* The combined company will expand Charter’s award-winning local Spectrum News stations in the Cox footprint, bringing hyper-local, unbiased news coverage to more communities. The combined company will not own any national programming,\n* The combined company will retain its industry leadership in protecting the security of U.S. communications networks from foreign threats. \n\n# Financial Outlook \n\nBy deploying Charter’s operating strategy across Cox’s footprint, the combined company will: \n\n* Offer Cox customers the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans,\n* Invest in more U.S.-based employees,\n* Continually improve service quality,\n* And support the development of third-party platforms for new consumer products through continuing network evolution. \n\nDespite those investments, the combined business is expected to produce higher cash flow per passing and investment returns over time by creating and preserving more relationships on a fixed network, selling more products to each customer, and reducing operating and capital costs per passing by lowering service transactions, churn and fixed cost leverage.  \n\nCharter also currently expects approximately $500 million of annualized cost synergies achieved within three years of close – stemming from typical procurement and overhead savings. \n\n  \nLink: [https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies](https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies)",

         "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html\n\n\n> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \n\n> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.\n\n> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\n\n- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected\n\n> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.\n\n> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.\n\n> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",

         "So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla's current valuation is equal to the sum of the world's seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face \"Earnings Catch-up\", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla's sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla's main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?\n\nIn my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.\n\nMy teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called \"Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room\".\n\nTherefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past. Beliefs and slogans are like the horn of the technological paradise, gathering a large number of irrational investors.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of pure finance and financial market technical theory, the financial pressure that Tesla needs to fulfill in 2026 is so great that it is suffocating, or even desperate. There have been many investors who scolded me while listening to my analysis. This is because they do not understand technology and only know how to buy and sell. In the past few years, they only read the parts of investment research reports that they like to read. They regard the risk part as a joke.\n\nThis involves a core issue. Musk said \"he doesn't care about making cars anymore\", which is good, and it can get rid of the problem of \"car manufacturer pricing\". But it faces the second problem of \"how to price Tesla\". Robotaxi? From an objective technical point of view, it is unknown when Tesla's Robotaxi will catch up with Waymo.

         "UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments. Rising medical costs, an unexpected CEO departure, and heightened regulatory uncertainty stemming from former President Trump’s recent executive order on drug pricing have all contributed to investor unease.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the stock may appear attractively valued following its sharp decline, caution is warranted. The current environment remains highly uncertain, and further downside risks could materialize in the near term. As a result, I am bearish on UNH.\n\n\n\nRising Medical Costs Rattle Nerves\n\nUNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization. Since then, investors have naturally kept dumping shares as faith in UNH’s cost management faltered.\n\n\n\nCEO Exit Sparks Leadership Crisis\n\nAs the dust was settling, UNH dropped a bombshell: CEO Andrew Witty resigned abruptly two days ago for “personal reasons,” and the company withdrew its prior full-year outlook. Stephen Hemsley, a former CEO and current chairman, stepped back into the top role, but the move feels like an unplanned stopgap.\n\n\n\nWitty’s departure caps a rough year for the company, one that saw a massive cyberattack exposing the data of 190 million customers and the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Notably, the fact that his resignation came right after UNH missed earnings for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis has raised questions about what else might be going wrong behind the scenes. At 72 years of age, analysts see Hemsley as a temporary fix. So that has, reasonably so, only added to investor anxiety over the company’s lack of a long-term plan.\n\n\n\nThe craziest part is that UNH’s leadership void couldn’t come at a worse time. UNH faces scrutiny over soaring medical costs and public outrage tied to Thompson’s killing, which sparked debates about insurer practices. Witty had driven UNH’s revenue to $400 billion, but recent stumbles eroded confidence. With Hemsley steering a ship under regulatory and operational strain, the absence of a long-term leader risks keeping UNH’s stock in the penalty box.\n\n\n\nTrump’s Drug Pricing Order Targets PBMs\n\nHowever, the most decisive blow landed on Monday this week, when President Trump signed an executive order to slash U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower costs abroad. This wasn’t just a hit to drugmakers as it directly aimed at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like UNH’s Optum Rx, accusing them of inflating costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters reported that the order seeks to skip PBMs, potentially disrupting their role in negotiating drug prices. Clearly, the broader threat to Optum Rx’s margins looms large, especially as analysts warn of legal and regulatory hurdles that could prolong uncertainty.\n\n\n\nA Bargain with Baggage\n\nOn paper, one could argue that UNH looks like a steal. Trading at roughly 13x this year’s consensus EPS, it’s a far cry from its historical premium, while the 55% share price plunge, which has primarily taken place in just a month, suggests the market may have overreacted.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that UNH isn’t a small-cap with a speculative business model but an insurance behemoth that generates revenues over $400 billion per annum. It has a fantastic track record of generating high returns on capital and returning cash to shareholders.\n\n\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nStill, the risks are hard to ignore. Trump’s executive order could compress PBM profits if drug prices fall without offsetting gains elsewhere.

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.\n\nHis comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.\n\n\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\n\"Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.\"\n\nA representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.\n\nMany U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.\n\nAs a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.\n\nEvery week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.\n\nWalmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tells-walmart-eat-tariffs-144516437.html",

The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tells-walmart-eat-tariffs-144516437.html",

         "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

         "Charter Communications and Cox Communications Announce Definitive Agreement to Combine Companies",
         "# Key Takeaways\n\n* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.\n* The combination will benefit customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\n* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n\n**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA** – Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1) based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.\n\n“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.” \n\nThe Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”\n\n“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”\n\n# Structure and Timing \n\nIn the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on: \n\n* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and\n* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.\n\nAs consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:\n\n*  $4 billion in cash,\n* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and\n* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. \n\nBased on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. \n\nWithin a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. \n\n# Governance \n\nFollowing the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. \n\nIt is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. \n\nUpon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. \n\n# Community Leadership \n\nThe Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges. \n\n# Strategic and Customer Objectives \n\nFollowing the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans. \n\nThe new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments.

         "Charter Communications and Cox Communications Announce Definitive Agreement to Combine Companies. # Key Takeaways\n\n* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.\n* The combination will benefit customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\n* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n\n**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA** – Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1) based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.\n\n“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.” \n\nThe Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”\n\n“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”\n\n# Structure and Timing \n\nIn the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on: \n\n* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and\n* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.\n\nAs consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:\n\n*  $4 billion in cash,\n* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and\n* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. \n\nBased on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. \n\nWithin a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. \n\n# Governance \n\nFollowing the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. \n\nIt is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. \n\nUpon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. \n\n# Community Leadership \n\nThe Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges. \n\n# Strategic and Customer Objectives \n\nFollowing the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans. \n\nThe new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments. Charter customers will benefit from Cox Business’ well-known industry leadership in business telecommunications, including Segra and RapidScale. \n\nCharter and Cox employees will benefit from investments in employee-focused technology and AI tools and an expansion of Charter’s self-progression career advancement model for promotions and standardized pay increases. \n\n# Specific Benefits From the Combination Include: \n\n* The combined company will bring together the best products and practices of each company to benefit all of the combined company’s customers and employees.\n* The combined company will be better positioned to aggressively compete in an expanding and dynamic marketplace that includes:\n   * Larger, national broadband companies with wireline and wireless capabilities,\n   * Regional wireline and mobile competitors,\n   * Global video distribution providers and platforms, and satellite broadband companies.\n* The combined company also will be better positioned for continued and expanded investment and innovation:\n   * In mobile, given the increased footprint;\n   * In video, where Big Tech currently leverages global scale in content and distribution;\n   * In advertising, where the transaction will expand opportunities for advertisers large and small, national, regional, and local, bringing new competition in an area now dominated by Big Tech;\n   * In the business sector, where the combined company will have additional coverage, yet still remain a regional player competing against larger, national competitors;\n   * And through greater product innovation in areas including AI tools and small cell deployment of licensed, shared licensed and unlicensed spectrum, bringing new and advanced services and capabilities to consumers and businesses.\n* Cox customers will gain access to Charter’s simple and transparent pricing and packaging structure, including no annual contracts for any residential services, which means customers are free to change service providers at any time, with no risk of early termination fees.\n* Cox customers also will benefit from Charter’s industry-first Customer Service Commitments, which include:\n   * Charter’s 100% U.S.-based customer service team available 24/7.\n   * Charter has committed to fixing service disruptions quickly, including same-day technician dispatch when requested before 5:00 pm; if not, the next day.\n   * Charter provides customers credits for outages that last longer than two hours.\n* This proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.\n   * The combined company will adopt Charter’s sales and service workforce model, which will fully return Cox’s customer service function to the U.S.\n   * ­All employees will earn a starting wage of *at least* $20 per hour and will gain access to Charter’s industry-leading benefits, which include:\n      * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees; Charter has absorbed the full premium cost increase for the last 12 years.\n      * Market-leading retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with a company match up to 6% of their eligible pay, with an additional 3% contribution available for most employees.\n      * Free or discounted Spectrum Mobile, TV and Internet service.\n      * Multiple opportunities for upward advancement and to build careers, including through tuition-free undergraduate degree and certificate programs via flexible online learning; self-progression programs with standardized pay raises, and formal development programs, such as the Broadband Field Technician Apprenticeship program.\n      * Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides frontline employees the ability to purchase stock and receive a matching grant of Charter Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) up to 1 for 1 based on years of service, offering employees another meaningful incentive to grow their careers with Charter.\n* The combined company will expand Charter’s award-winning local Spectrum News stations in the Cox footprint, bringing hyper-local, unbiased news coverage to more communities.

         "Walmart CFO says price hikes from tariffs could start later this month, as retailer beats on earnings",
         "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html\n\n\n> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \n\n> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.\n\n> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\n\n- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected\n\n> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.\n\n> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.\n\n> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",

         "Why Tesla is another Enron - How can a company with a valuation equal to the world's seven largest automakers Earnings Catch-up",
         "So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla's current valuation is equal to the sum of the world's seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face \"Earnings Catch-up\", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla's sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla's main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?\n\nIn my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.\n\nMy teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called \"Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room\".\n\nTherefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past. Beliefs and slogans are like the horn of the technological paradise, gathering a large number of irrational investors.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of pure finance and financial market technical theory, the financial pressure that Tesla needs to fulfill in 2026 is so great that it is suffocating, or even desperate. There have been many investors who scolded me while listening to my analysis. This is because they do not understand technology and only know how to buy and sell. In the past few years, they only read the parts of investment research reports that they like to read. They regard the risk part as a joke.\n\nThis involves a core issue. Musk said \"he doesn't care about making cars anymore\", which is good, and it can get rid of the problem of \"car manufacturer pricing\". But it faces the second problem of \"how to price Tesla\". Robotaxi? From an objective technical point of view, it is unknown when Tesla's Robotaxi will catch up with Waymo. After all, Waymo completed L4 autonomous driving as early as 2019, while FSD is still L2 to this day. Many people don't know that it is actually L2, not even L3.\n\nBipedal robots? From the perspective of the academic community in Australia and Europe, that is a joke. Not to mention Japan, a robot powerhouse, where even FANUC is not so optimistic.\n\nMore carbon credits? Yes, but the scale of growth will be limited unless the White House gives more taxpayer money.\n\n\n\nSpeculating on Bitcoin, using data centers to mine Bitcoin? It's not impossible, after all, are they scammers?\n\n\nHumankind has not made any breakthroughs in basic science since the 1980s. Europe has been working hard to make breakthroughs in basic science, so they spent a huge amount of time to build colliders, while the United States has invested billions of dollars in mining and AI. This is the problem the United States faces today.\n\nThis article would be worth $50,000 if I were giving a talk, so I won’t go into too much detail, just to add to the urge to pee when I wake up late at night in Australia.\n",

Musk said \"he doesn't care about making cars anymore\", which is good, and it can get rid of the problem of \"car manufacturer pricing\". But it faces the second problem of \"how to price Tesla\". Robotaxi? From an objective technical point of view, it is unknown when Tesla's Robotaxi will catch up with Waymo. After all, Waymo completed L4 autonomous driving as early as 2019, while FSD is still L2 to this day. Many people don't know that it is actually L2, not even L3.\n\nBipedal robots? From the perspective of the academic community in Australia and Europe, that is a joke. Not to mention Japan, a robot powerhouse, where even FANUC is not so optimistic.\n\nMore carbon credits? Yes, but the scale of growth will be limited unless the White House gives more taxpayer money.\n\n\n\nSpeculating on Bitcoin, using data centers to mine Bitcoin? It's not impossible, after all, are they scammers?\n\n\nHumankind has not made any breakthroughs in basic science since the 1980s. Europe has been working hard to make breakthroughs in basic science, so they spent a huge amount of time to build colliders, while the United States has invested billions of dollars in mining and AI. This is the problem the United States faces today.\n\nThis article would be worth $50,000 if I were giving a talk, so I won’t go into too much detail, just to add to the urge to pee when I wake up late at night in Australia.\n",

         "UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments. Rising medical costs, an unexpected CEO departure, and heightened regulatory uncertainty stemming from former President Trump’s recent executive order on drug pricing have all contributed to investor unease.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the stock may appear attractively valued following its sharp decline, caution is warranted. The current environment remains highly uncertain, and further downside risks could materialize in the near term. As a result, I am bearish on UNH.\n\n\n\nRising Medical Costs Rattle Nerves\n\nUNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization. Since then, investors have naturally kept dumping shares as faith in UNH’s cost management faltered.\n\n\n\nCEO Exit Sparks Leadership Crisis\n\nAs the dust was settling, UNH dropped a bombshell: CEO Andrew Witty resigned abruptly two days ago for “personal reasons,” and the company withdrew its prior full-year outlook. Stephen Hemsley, a former CEO and current chairman, stepped back into the top role, but the move feels like an unplanned stopgap.\n\n\n\nWitty’s departure caps a rough year for the company, one that saw a massive cyberattack exposing the data of 190 million customers and the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Notably, the fact that his resignation came right after UNH missed earnings for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis has raised questions about what else might be going wrong behind the scenes. At 72 years of age, analysts see Hemsley as a temporary fix. So that has, reasonably so, only added to investor anxiety over the company’s lack of a long-term plan.\n\n\n\nThe craziest part is that UNH’s leadership void couldn’t come at a worse time. UNH faces scrutiny over soaring medical costs and public outrage tied to Thompson’s killing, which sparked debates about insurer practices. Witty had driven UNH’s revenue to $400 billion, but recent stumbles eroded confidence. With Hemsley steering a ship under regulatory and operational strain, the absence of a long-term leader risks keeping UNH’s stock in the penalty box.\n\n\n\nTrump’s Drug Pricing Order Targets PBMs\n\nHowever, the most decisive blow landed on Monday this week, when President Trump signed an executive order to slash U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower costs abroad. This wasn’t just a hit to drugmakers as it directly aimed at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like UNH’s Optum Rx, accusing them of inflating costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters reported that the order seeks to skip PBMs, potentially disrupting their role in negotiating drug prices. Clearly, the broader threat to Optum Rx’s margins looms large, especially as analysts warn of legal and regulatory hurdles that could prolong uncertainty.\n\n\n\nA Bargain with Baggage\n\nOn paper, one could argue that UNH looks like a steal. Trading at roughly 13x this year’s consensus EPS, it’s a far cry from its historical premium, while the 55% share price plunge, which has primarily taken place in just a month, suggests the market may have overreacted.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that UNH isn’t a small-cap with a speculative business model but an insurance behemoth that generates revenues over $400 billion per annum. It has a fantastic track record of generating high returns on capital and returning cash to shareholders.\n\n\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nStill, the risks are hard to ignore. Trump’s executive order could compress PBM profits if drug prices fall without offsetting gains elsewhere.

Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal.

Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) \\- Alibaba reported Q4 revenue of 236.45B yuan, a 7% increase year-over-year, but slightly below analyst expectations of 237.91B yuan.

It has launched fully autonomous Robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. It has been successfully running for six years since 2019, although there have been many funny accidents during this period. But Waymo at least dares to claim that it has L4, not L3, or L3 plus, or like FSD, which is obviously L2 but induces the driver to let go. (By the way, L2 allows the driver to take both hands off the steering wheel, and only the United States can do this in the world).\n\nSo Tesla doesn't even have L4 autonomous driving, so what can it use to compete with Waymo, which dares to apply for L4 and uses lidar technology that is ridiculed by Tesla fans. L2 means that the responsibility is put on the driver, but L4 requires Waymo to pay for every accident with real money.\n\nAs of 15/May/2025 (sorry, we are used to typing dates like this in Australia). Tesla has not submitted an application for L4 autonomous driving, so I would like to ask Tesla fans. What will they use to make Cybercab on June 19?

         "In the past, turning water into wine was considered a biblical miracle. However, with the rise of AI, anyone can now do this incredible feat by investing in Landbridge.\n\nLandbridge is a company that owns land, focusing on the Delaware sub-basin within the Permian Basin. For those unaware, this region is known for having the most active oil and natural gas exploration in the US. If this sounds familiar, its business model and area of activity is similar to the highly successful Teas Pacific ($TPL). However, a massive difference between TPL and LB is LB primarily relies on water royalties for their revenues.\n\nLet's break down their most recent 1Q25 Earnings: [https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc\\_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck\\_vF.pdf](https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck_vF.pdf)\n\nRevenue came in at $44M, up 131% YoY. 59% came from royalties of land usage. 33% Came from royalties of sales of water/products obtained from land. Only 8% came from royalties from actual Oil & Gas Production. The bulk of these revenues are due to the water needs of high power data centers. As companies continue to develop $10B+ data centers, the access of water is what enables the usage of these centers, creating a continuous revenue opportunity for LB.\n\nThe key takeaway is Landbridge does not take on any production/capex risk- it is simply a landowner that allows other companies to operate their production on their assets. This makes it an extremely high margin business, making Visa/Nvidia look inefficient.\n\nThe company boasts \"adjusted EBITDA\" margins of 88%. That being said, current GAAP net margins are at 35%, a far cry from the expected 90% management alludes to. This is due to SBC and Interest Expense  due to debt issued to fuel land acquisition. In addition, quarterly FCF is down 40% YoY from $27M to $16M. This is due to a temporary increase in accounts receivable that will be normalized as revenue is recognized.\n\nI personally believe that this is palatable for the moment. There is only so much prime attractive land and I would rather LB acquire it now to generate incredible cash flow in the future. For example, the most recent purchase of Bone Ranch for $245M. This led to a 70% QoQ increase in water royalty volumes and will bring in a MINIMUM of $25M per year for the next 5 years. Again, this is all revenue with essentially 90% margins. These are accretive purchases that will payoff tenfold in the coming years.\n\nAs Landbridge continues to engage in accretive M&A to accelerate high margin revenue, the thesis continues to strengthen alongside the growth of water intensive data centers.",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

Could this be a reverse arbitrage play if I do my research and believe that the deal will fall through? What is the downside since the Foot Locker stock is unlikely to rise much more? ",

These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.\n\nOne objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year.

         "Tesla limits investors' ability to sue over breach of fiduciary duties",
         "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

Personally, this market doesn't make sense to me. Originally, I thought it was quite over sold, especially parts of the market, but now I feel like it's gone the other direction. I guess we will see.",

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.\n\nHis comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.\n\n\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\n\"Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.\"\n\nA representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.\n\nMany U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.\n\nAs a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.\n\nEvery week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.\n\nWalmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products.

         "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.\n\nHis comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.\n\n\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\n\"Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.\"\n\nA representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.\n\nMany U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.\n\nAs a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.\n\nEvery week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.\n\nWalmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tells-walmart-eat-tariffs-144516437.html",

Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.\n\nMany U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.\n\nAs a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.\n\nEvery week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.\n\nWalmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products.

         "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”\n\nTesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

         "Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.\n\n**Why am I writing these?**\n\nBecause I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.\n\n**What is eToro?**\n\neToro is a \"social trading\" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nLaunched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\n|Year|Net Income|Funded Accounts|EBITDA:|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|||||\n|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|\n|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|\n|2022|\\-$21M|2.8M|\\-$43M|\n\n**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**\n\n**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  \n**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  \n**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  \n**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.\n\n**Global User Base**\n\nEurope & UK: \\~70% of funded accounts.  \nAsia-Pacific: \\~16%.  \nAmericas (U.S. + Latin America): \\~10%.  \nMiddle East & Africa: \\~4%.\n\neToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.\n\n**Risks:** The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and \"Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)\".\n\nSo during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. \n\nAnother thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.\n\nIf WeBull is any indication, it might be. Overall, will be watching the L2 and the indication prices to see how it goes.",

         "Financial technology company Chime on Tuesday filed paperwork to go public on the Nasdaq. The company intends to file under the ticker symbol “CHYM.”\n\n“Chime is a technology company, not a bank,” the company said in its prospectus, noting it is not a member of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Still, the company cited Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and Wells Fargo as competitors.\n\nAccording to the filing, Chime picks up revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases that members make with Chime debit cards and credit cards. Banks collect interchange fees, which are generally a percentage of the transaction value, plus a set amount for each transaction depending on the rates determined by card networks such as Visa. The banks then pass money on to Chime.\n\nIn the March quarter, Chime generated $12.9 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue. Revenue grew 32%, while profit narrowed from $15.9 million.\n\nAt the end of March, Chime had 8.6 million active members, up about 23% year over year. Average revenue per active member, at $251, was up from $231. It has members in all 50 states — it doesn’t operate outside the U.S. — and 55% of them are female. The average member age is 36, according to Chime.\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/fintech-company-chime-files-for-nasdaq-ipo.html)",

         "Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.\n\nOne objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html)",

         "I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the \"smart money\" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the \"smart money\" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.\n\nFrom the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%.

Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions.

         "[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.\n\n**Why am I writing these?**\n\nBecause I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.\n\n**What is eToro?**\n\neToro is a \"social trading\" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nLaunched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\n|Year|Net Income|Funded Accounts|EBITDA:|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|||||\n|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|\n|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|\n|2022|\\-$21M|2.8M|\\-$43M|\n\n**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**\n\n**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  \n**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  \n**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  \n**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.\n\n**Global User Base**\n\nEurope & UK: \\~70% of funded accounts.  \nAsia-Pacific: \\~16%.  \nAmericas (U.S. + Latin America): \\~10%.  \nMiddle East & Africa: \\~4%.\n\neToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.\n\n**Risks:** The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading.

They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.\n\n**Risks:** The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and \"Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)\".\n\nSo during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. \n\nAnother thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.\n\nIf WeBull is any indication, it might be. Overall, will be watching the L2 and the indication prices to see how it goes.",

         "Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains",
         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.\n\n**Why am I writing these?**\n\nBecause I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.\n\n**What is eToro?**\n\neToro is a \"social trading\" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nLaunched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\n|Year|Net Income|Funded Accounts|EBITDA:|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|||||\n|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|\n|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|\n|2022|\\-$21M|2.8M|\\-$43M|\n\n**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**\n\n**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  \n**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  \n**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  \n**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.\n\n**Global User Base**\n\nEurope & UK: \\~70% of funded accounts.  \nAsia-Pacific: \\~16%.  \nAmericas (U.S. + Latin America): \\~10%.  \nMiddle East & Africa: \\~4%.\n\neToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.\n\n**Risks:** The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and \"Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)\".\n\nSo during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. \n\nAnother thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.\n\nIf WeBull is any indication, it might be. Overall, will be watching the L2 and the indication prices to see how it goes.",

If it’s so easy to just invest in index funds, why doesn’t everyone do it? Currently it trades at around 285, how much should we expect in 40 years? 2000+?",

         "Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

         "Google needs 'big bang breakup' that would value its businesses at $3.7 trillion as AI threatens Search. Goog is one of my largest positions. I'm bullish on the company and thinking about going all in.\n\nThe stock has been punished for fears it seems to be:\n\n1. Out of the AI race (it's not, Gemini is fantastic)\n2. Search is dead (it's not but it probably will be given enough time. However, it could easily be like tobacco companies that have great margins and exist for decades as solid businesses without growth due to personal habits)\n3. Will be broken up\n\nThis last point is fascinating to me because as I understand it, if it were to be broken up, shareholders would receive shares in all of the constituent parts. \n\nMeaning, I would get a shares in GCP, YouTube, Search, Waymo, etc. I would LOVE to have shares in any of those businesses individually. \n\nThe article below values all of Google's businesses at a staggering $3.7 trillion.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-needs-big-bang-breakup-that-would-value-its-businesses-at-37-trillion-as-ai-threatens-search-analyst-171143842.html?guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAADxZpheK3u8TveRxgpzmaZCVXvQ7wAOPpW-pIlY8Xa6bYSOX99OVwn9LAuPPLqTzyKGtgE7I74IzSfrlQUAWHvaU53JttuhwRj4hUNZpWhflmHfDyjLhHxhX7YXdK\\_b68waPP1g545TNU2lkXrZJWlAiysD8Px6AqA6xPVXqThK7&guccounter=2](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-needs-big-bang-breakup-that-would-value-its-businesses-at-37-trillion-as-ai-threatens-search-analyst-171143842.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADxZpheK3u8TveRxgpzmaZCVXvQ7wAOPpW-pIlY8Xa6bYSOX99OVwn9LAuPPLqTzyKGtgE7I74IzSfrlQUAWHvaU53JttuhwRj4hUNZpWhflmHfDyjLhHxhX7YXdK_b68waPP1g545TNU2lkXrZJWlAiysD8Px6AqA6xPVXqThK7&guccounter=2)",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.\n\nShares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.\n\n**Why am I writing these?**\n\nBecause I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.\n\n**What is eToro?**\n\neToro is a \"social trading\" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nLaunched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\n|Year|Net Income|Funded Accounts|EBITDA:|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|||||\n|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|\n|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|\n|2022|\\-$21M|2.8M|\\-$43M|\n\n**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**\n\n**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  \n**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  \n**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  \n**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.\n\n**Global User Base**\n\nEurope & UK: \\~70% of funded accounts.  \nAsia-Pacific: \\~16%.  \nAmericas (U.S. + Latin America): \\~10%.  \nMiddle East & Africa: \\~4%.\n\neToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.\n\n**Risks:** The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and \"Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)\".\n\nSo during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. \n\nAnother thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.\n\nIf WeBull is any indication, it might be. Overall, will be watching the L2 and the indication prices to see how it goes.",

If it’s so easy to just invest in index funds, why doesn’t everyone do it? Currently it trades at around 285, how much should we expect in 40 years? 2000+?",

         "Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.\n\nQatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”\n\n[CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/boeing-qatar-trump-plane-deal.html)",

The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure.

As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.\n\nThe department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.\n\n“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.\n\n“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",

         "Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.\n\nShares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.\n\nNVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.\n\nNvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.\n\nU.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.\n\nIn a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”\n\n“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”\n\nInvestors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt.

Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels and geographies.\n\n“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nThe company reported better-than-expected results and an upbeat quarterly forecast in late April.\n\nMicrosoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees.\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.\n\nOne objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html)",

         "I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the \"smart money\" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the \"smart money\" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.\n\nFrom the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%.

Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions.

Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high.

         "[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.\n\n**Why am I writing these?**\n\nBecause I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.\n\n**What is eToro?**\n\neToro is a \"social trading\" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nLaunched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\n|Year|Net Income|Funded Accounts|EBITDA:|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|||||\n|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|\n|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|\n|2022|\\-$21M|2.8M|\\-$43M|\n\n**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**\n\n**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  \n**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  \n**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  \n**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.\n\n**Global User Base**\n\nEurope & UK: \\~70% of funded accounts.  \nAsia-Pacific: \\~16%.  \nAmericas (U.S. + Latin America): \\~10%.  \nMiddle East & Africa: \\~4%.\n\neToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations.

They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.\n\n|Company|eToro|Robinhood|Coinbase|Webull|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Funded Accounts|\\~3.5M|\\~25M|100M+|\\~3-5M|\n|2024 Revenue|$931M|$2.95B|$6.56B|\\~$390M|\n|2024 Net Income|$192M|$1.41B|$2.58B|\\~breakeven|\n|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|\n|Market Cap|\\~$4B (IPO target)|\\~$55B|\\~$65B|\\~$6B|\n\neToro’s valuation (\\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.\n\n**Risks:** The F-1 admits that \"Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets\", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and \"Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)\".\n\nSo during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. \n\nAnother thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.\n\nIf WeBull is any indication, it might be. Overall, will be watching the L2 and the indication prices to see how it goes.",
