They had previously faced issues from store thefts, bloated inventories and declining sales as shoppers switched to more cost friendly retailers. And this was all before tariffs took center stage. \n\n\nNow Target has cut their 2025 forecast as revenue decreases and in store shopping drops. Adjusted earnings also came in notably lower. Target CEO avoided saying whether prices would increase because of tariff pressures, but the headwinds continue to mount. \n\n\nA few brighter spots are growing digital sales and increased same day delivery. Both full year revenue and earnings have been adjusted down and Target has created a new initiative to address the challenges. But overall the macro environment and company specific challenges have beaten down Target badly.\n\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/target-q1-fy2025-earnings-11737714",

The\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0shed 0.9%, while the\u00a0Nasdaq Composite\u00a0slid 0.7%.\n\nThe\u00a030-year Treasury\u00a0bond yield last traded around 5.07%, while the benchmark\u00a010-year Treasury\u00a0note yield traded at 4.58%. Yields topped those key levels earlier in the week after Moody\u2019s downgraded U.S. bonds late Friday.\n\nThe latest moves come as traders look to Washington as Republican leaders work to finalize a budget bill that would lower taxes. Investors also worry the measure could worsen the U.S. deficit.\n\n\u201cThe questions now is, from a fiscal perspective, what will the tax bill look like, and will it undo all of the recent fiscal frugality by simply raising the debt level at a slower rate of pace? So I think that\u2019s why the 10-year yield is moving higher \u2014 because investors are worried that we\u2019re really not doing anything to slow the pace of inflation and to reduce the debt,\u201d Sam Stovall, CFRA Research chief investment strategist, told CNBC in an interview.\n\n\u201cNow it seems as if there is a greater chance that the tax bill will pass, and that could end up simply continuing to raise the overall debt level,\u201d he continued.\n\nTreasury yields had spiked last month as worries over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs dented confidence in the safe haven status of U.S. debt. The 10-year in April swung from below 3.9% to more than 4.5% in just days. Yields eased from those levels after Trump announced delays on when the levies would take effect.\n\nUnitedHealth\u00a0was the worst-performing Dow member, losing more than 5% after a downgrade from HSBC. Major tech-related stocks\u00a0Apple\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0also dropped as rates increased.\n\nWednesday\u2019s action comes after a\u00a0tough session\u00a0for the three major averages. The S&P 500 ended a six-day win streak, while the Nasdaq saw its first negative day in three.\n\nThe major averages have staged sharp recoveries since a sell-off last month that engulfed markets after Trump unveiled steep tariffs on imported goods. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up more than 14% and 19%, respectively, in the past month.\n\n\u201cSome \\[investors\\] are a little worried that we\u2019ve gone too far, too fast, and are due for some digestion of recent gains,\u201d Stovall added.",

      "text": "Wednesday\u2019s setup is looking weaker for equities as surging bond yields start to rattle some nerves ahead of an important auction later.\n\nFlying in the face of this fear is Morgan Stanley and a bullish call of the day that sees the bank shift to an overweight on U.S. stocks and bonds. \u201cSlow-but-not-dire growth makes us neutral on global stocks and constructive on fixed income, but with a strong regional preference for the U.S. across assets,\u201d said a team of strategists including Mike Wilson.\n\nThe team previously saw the S&P 500 \ufffc reaching 6,500 by the end of 2025, and now see that as a base case for the second quarter of 2026 \u2014 rolling it forward in their words. Their bull case calls for a 21% jump to 7,200 by June 2026 and a drop to 4,900 in a bear case (all from a May 19 level of 5,964).\n\nWhy the bullish turn? \u201cWe\u2019ve already experienced rolling earnings recessions across the equity market for the last [approximately] three years. This makes comparisons less onerous and sets the stage for a more synchronous EPS [earnings per share] recovery over the course of our forecast horizon,\u201d said Morgan Stanley\u2019s team.\n\nThe earnings path should be aided by Fed rate cuts in 2026, dollar\nweakness, as well as a broader realization of AI-driven efficiency gains,\u201d they said.\n\nAnd Morgan Stanley thinks the worst is over for stocks. \u201cFrom our perspective, the level of tariffs announced on \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 was so dramatic, it led to what can only be described as capitulatory price action. As a result, we think that the price lows are in assuming we don\u2019t experience a deep recession,\u201d they said.\n\nhttps://on.mktw.net/43F8OSX Check out this article from MarketWatch - Morgan Stanley turns bullish on U.S. stocks.

      "text": "PLANO, Texas \u2014 The top-selling SUV in the United States will exclusively be offered as a hybrid model as part of a redesign of the RAV4 lineup,\u00a0Toyota Motor\u00a0announced Tuesday night.\n\nThe world\u2019s\u00a0largest automaker\u00a0said the 2026 Toyota RAV4 only will be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating a traditional gas engine in the vehicle for the first time. It will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but with hybrid technologies such as batteries and electric motors.\n\nDespite a slower-than-expected\u00a0adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers have looked to\u00a0hybrid models\u00a0\u2014 which combine electric vehicle technologies with traditional internal combustion engines \u2014 to increase performance and help them meet fuel economy regulations.\n\nToyota, which started offering hybrids with the\u00a0Toyota Prius in late 1990s, has been a global leader and advocate for hybrid adoption, despite an industry push in recent years for automakers to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles.\n\nToyota\u2019s electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. \u2014 including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles \u2014 accounted for 43.1% of the company\u2019s 2.3 million units sold domestically in 2024.\n\nRAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year to nearly 475,200 units sold, including a 29.3% increase in RAV4 hybrids and 19.3% gain in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids.\n\nSales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models\u00a0reached a record 20%\u00a0of new car and truck sales in the U.S. last year, to 3.2 million electrified vehicles, according to auto data firm Motor Intelligence. That encompasses 1.9 million hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, and 1.3 million all-electric models.\n\n# Hybrid-only\n\nDavid Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said the company decided to exclusively offer the RAV4 as a hybrid because of its already established popularity and growing customer demand.\n\n\u201cThe hybrid is faster turning; it has more sales orders on it, and the consumers and dealers are asking for it,\u201d he told CNBC Tuesday during an event at the automaker\u2019s North American headquarters. \u201cIt was pretty clear that the consumer is voting for the hybrid.\u201d\n\nChrist said the automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.\n\nSeven of Toyota\u2019s current vehicles are exclusively hybrid models, including the Camry and Prius cars, Sienna minivan and Sequoia SUV. RAV4 will be the eighth.\n\nRAV4 hybrids accounted for 44% of sales last year, Toyota reported, while plug-in models \u2014 which offer all-electric ranges with a traditional engine that needs to be plugged in \u2014 were 6.5%.\n\nThe redesigned RAV4 is set to go on sale at U.S. Toyota dealerships in later this year. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign of the vehicle that included interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to the vehicle\u2019s performance and technologies.\n\nThe company declined to disclose pricing until closer to the vehicle\u2019s launch. The current RAV4 starts at $30,645. The hybrid variant starts at about $33,700. Pricing includes mandatory delivery fees.\n\nThe RAV4 has steadily increased sales since its U.S. introduction for the 1996 model year. Last year\u2019s sales of the vehicle increased 9.3% year-over-year to a new record \u2014 making it the best-selling non-pickup nameplate in the U.S. last year.\n\n# Tariffs\n\nThe RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing\u00a0tariffs\u00a0of 25% on vehicles imported into the U.S., as well as many auto parts.\n\nToyota produces the RAV4 at a\u00a0plant\u00a0in Kentucky, but a majority of its U.S. sales come from vehicles built at a plant in Ontario, Canada. It currently exclusively imports plug-in hybrid models for U.S. consumers from Japan.\n\nRoughly half of Toyota\u2019s U.S. sales are imported from outside of the U.S., including 84.3% of RAV4 models, as well as its popular Tacoma midsize pickup truck from Mexico.\n\nMark Templin, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said the company plans to produce more RAV4 models at its Kentucky plant, but declined to offer specific plans for potential changes in production to mitigate tariffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll work its way out. I think we\u2019ll build more RAV4s in Kentucky, which will help. But that\u2019s such a big volume car. \u2026 It was the No. 1 selling vehicle in the entire market, even beating out the F-150,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cNow we\u2019re bringing out one that\u2019s even better than that car. So, I think that we\u2019re going to need multiple plants to build that.\u201d\n\nCox Automotive reports the RAV4 finished third in sales last year behind the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado truck models, which include several variants. However, other\u00a0third-party data firms\u00a0have said the RAV4 topped sales of the Detroit pickups last year when breaking out the models, such as the Ford F-150 from the larger group.\n\nToyota\u2019s days\u2019 supply \u2014 an adjusted number based on the rate of sales \u2014 has been among the lowest in the automotive industry, especially for the RAV4.\n\nCox Automotive reports Toyota\u2019s recent\u00a0days\u2019 supply is at 29 days and the RAV4 is among the fastest-selling vehicles in the automotive industry.\u00a0The industry average is 66 days, according to Cox.\n\nTemplin said the automaker has been conducting scenario planning for different tariff and production outcomes, but the situation remains fluid amid Trump\u2019s trade negotiations with other countries.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing for an industry is uncertainty,\u201d Templin said. \u201cConsistency is the best thing we could all ask for.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/toyota-2026-rav4-hybrid.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/toyota-2026-rav4-hybrid.html)",

Meta and Luxottica in 2023\u00a0launched the second edition\u00a0of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported.

      "title": "Fair Issac $FICO down 25% in two days over FHFA director comments to make provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\"",
      "text": "Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) stock\u00a0sank 18%\u00a0in Wednesday morning trading, following an 8% decline on Tuesday, after Federal Housing Finance Agency director William J. Pulte called for the\u00a0provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\" and for the privatization of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC).\n\nPulte specifically referred to Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) and its price increase for mortgage scores during Q&A at a mortgage industry conference on Tuesday. \"I think FICO should make sure they\u2019re being as economical as possible,\" he said. \"We\u2019re actively looking at getting it done. I don\u2019t like some things I\u2019ve heard in terms of the cost.\"\n\nBoth Oppenheimer and Jefferies issued notes defending FICO.\n\nJefferies advised clients to buy the dip. \"We continue to believe there is no material risk to FICO's long-term goal of increasing its share of economics within mortgage,\" analyst Surinder Thind wrote in a note to clients.\n\nPulte also proposed transitioning to a two-credit bureau report format from the current three-bureau, or tri-merge, format. The proposal is an option for lenders, not a requirement, noted Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, who believes that investors are overreacting to the comments.\n\nThe comment on making FICO more economical centers on the company's price increase on FICO mortgage scores to $4.95 per score in January 2025. Lau noted that the cost of the score only accounts for 25 basis points of the average mortgage closing cost of $6,000 and is the lowest compared with other costs such as tax stamp, appraisal, title insurance, and notary fees. \"We believe FICO still has a strong argument for the price increase,\" he said. \"It is unclear on what FHFA can do to limit FICO's price increase.\"\n\nThe privatization of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC), meanwhile, could open up credit score companies to more competition. But it would likely have little impact on FICO Score pricing, because it is so embedded in the mortgage lending and securitization processes, the analyst said. The score is reflected in 90%+ market shares in all public asset-backed securitization products.\n\nRegarding the option for a bi-merge report, instead of tri-merge, the Oppenheimer analyst doesn't expect that most lenders will switch to two credit bureaus as it would reduce originations and increase consumer costs. TransUnion (TRU), a FICO competitor, has estimated that if 5% of all new mortgage applications use bi-merge reports, \\~600K of those mortgages could result in higher interest rates with consumers paying $6,600 higher interest payments over the next 10 years.\n\nJefferies' Thind agrees that there's little likelihood a transition to bi-merge would significantly affect FICO, pointing to pushback from the Mortgage Bankers Association, five other industry groups, and several Republican senators who want to codify the tri-merge report into law. \"If the bi-merge were implemented and all lenders adopted it, our calculations suggest the maximum negative impact to FICO, EFX, and TRU adj EPS would be roughly -16%, -10%, and -10%, respectively,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nOpenheimer's Lau's overall view of FICO's (NYSE:FICO) stock decline: \"There are still a lot of details that have to be flushed out, but the knee-jerk reaction to Director Pulte's comments seems excessive. FICO Scores hold strong inherent value and remain integral to the mortgage lending ecosystem.\"\n\nLau has Outperform ratings on Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO), Equifax (EFX), and TransUnion (TRU).\n\nEquifax (EFX) stock\u00a0fell 5.7%,\u00a0and TransUnion (TRU)\u00a0slid 5.9%.",

That highlighted the way the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs campaign \u2014 peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods \u2014 is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.\n\nInvestors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nLast year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.\n\nThe value of phone component exports to India \u2014 home to Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone production base outside of China \u2014 roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China\u2019s General Administration of Customs.\n\nApple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home.

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they\u2019re physically inside\u201d the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang\u2019s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created \u201cGPU haves and GPU have nots.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.\u201d\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a \u201cfailure\u201d and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,\u201d he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies\u2019 access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n\u201cThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,\u201d said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. \u201cMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.\u201d",

I did not write the original posts.**\n\n[Link to the \"revisiting post\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kllo5f/1_year_later_revisiting_how_much_are_you_willing/)\n\n[Link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dgvrzy/how_much_are_you_willing_to_pay_for_perfection/)\n\nToday the news dropped that the Federal Housing Finance Agency director William J. Pulte called for the\u00a0provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\" and that Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac should be privatized.\n\nThere is literally no change in fundamentals, financials, (but there is a change on regulatory outlook) on this stock despite it dropping - frankly I find it insane that it's dropped this far (23%!) because the FHFA director says they're making too much money. We're back to April 7/8th tariff day lows, and I see this as a massive irrational move- the stock IS illiquid because it's priced so highly but adjusting price to liquidity, it has roughly a .3% liquidity spread (subtracting the bid from the ask and dividing by it) so it's frankly not too illiquid.\n\nI do think this is a trade that is worth swinging a little bit and I'm comfortable holding all the way back to new lows established today (\\~$1650).\n\nFICO is essentially as ingrained into the American system and way of life as Social Security, and if we took FICO away then frankly no one would be able to buy a house on credit and we'd need to depend on VantageScore or the opaque metrics that other credit bureaus use.\n\nI truly doubt any competitors can rise and disrupt this business, mainly due to almost every financial system in the US using FICO. Expecting banks to overhaul their credit scoring systems to save a few dollars by switching from FICO to VantageScore is like expecting Boeing to start assembling their planes in Mexico to save a few bucks- it's technically possible but operationally and regulatorily a massive PITA.",

      "text": "CATL is the world\u2019s leading EV battery maker and a symbol of Chinese dominance in green energy manufacturing. It\u2019s already very profitable. A company to watch closely as EV\u2019s grow. \n\nFrom Bloomberg: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. jumped in its Hong Kong trading debut after the Chinese battery giant wrapped up the world\u2019s biggest listing this year by raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) despite being blacklisted by the Pentagon and grinding through geopolitical storms.\n\nShares of CATL, as the largest maker of electric-vehicle batteries is known, climbed 16% to HK$306.20 on Tuesday. Though Hong Kong shares of Chinese companies typically trade at a discount to those in the mainland, CATL soared above its stock price in Shenzhen, where it rose 1.2%.\n\nFor investors, the allure of buying into a blue-chip stock at the forefront of electric-vehicle technology outweighed the risks of getting caught up in the ongoing turbulence in Sino-US relations. The success of the stock offering, which may increase to $5.3 billion if CATL exercises an option to do so, single-handedly doubled Hong Kong\u2019s proceeds from listings this year and could embolden other companies to go public. \n\nCATL is \u201ca true champion enabling the energy transition, a symbol of China\u2019s success as a global green leader,\u201d said Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital Group. \n\nPriced at around 17 times current earnings multiples, CATL\u2019s Hong Kong shares have room to rise 50%, driven by strong earnings and attractive valuations, said Johnson Wan, head of China industrials research at Jefferies in Hong Kong. \n\nCATL supplies batteries to top-tier customers such as Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. It has a market share of roughly 38% in electric-car batteries, comfortably ahead of its closest challenger, top EV maker BYD Co.\u2019s 17%, according to SNE Research.\n\nThe Ningde, Fujian-based company generated sales of $50 billion and net income of $7 billion last year. And it plans to build on that \u2014 recently unveiling batteries that can charge 520km (323 miles) of range in 5 minutes and up to 1,500km on a full charge. \n\nThe funding, much of it for a $7.6 billion overseas expansion in Europe, will be used to fuel its growth outside China, where profit margins are juicier.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/catl-set-to-debut-in-hong-kong-after-world-s-top-listing-in-2025",

      "text": "It's been one thing after another for United Health (UNH) lately:\n\nIt's been exposed for secretly giving money to nursing homes so they can transfer fewer patients to hospitals and save money on transfer fees, but in doing so, the patients' health is sometimes put at greater risk. The Department of Justice looked into it a couple years ago, and now they're opening a criminal investigation;\n\nThe CEO suddenly resigned and also just withdrew his 2025 earnings estimates;\n\nHSBC has also stepped in and downgraded its rating to \u201chold\u201d with a target price of 270;\n\nCoupled with soaring healthcare costs, hacking, and problems in the drug sector, ...... feels that the company is really going downhill.\n\nThe stock price plummeted at one point, but you think it was just a news-induced panic? There may actually be something else going on\n\nThe options expire this Friday, and the institutions were able to zero in on the most calls and puts, reaping the retail investor's profits in no uncertain terms. Do you think the market is \u201crationally reacting to the news\u201d? I think it's more like a news washout + manipulation.\n\nWhat do you think of this wave? Plunge now? Or continue to avoid the thunder?\n\nHonestly, I'm on the fence, but if the criminal investigation gets too big ...... it's not something that can be fixed with an earnings report.",

      "text": "A lot of people have been stumped about why markets have not been making sense. Trump announced tarrifs will go down but tariffs still hurt the economy and somehow the market goes up. 1 country strikes a trade deal and market goes up. Tesla reported terrible earnings then stock goes up. Moody's downgrade of US rating, as well as the largest store in the USA says prices will increase because of tariffs and market finishes positive during the first trading day after the news. None of it makes sense. \n\nSmart investors are looking to make sense of a stock in order to determine a buy or a sell but literally everything seems unpredictable.. The resounding answer from the community seems to be \"the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" and all the other common phrases you hear here. But what if it is being rational? \n\nI've seen a lot of the blame placed on institutional investors trying to manipulate the market or they don't know what they're doing. \"There's a reason 86% of them don't beat the S&P.\" But what if we have been placing blame on the wrong group? \n\nYTD institutions have taken more money out or bet against the market significantly more than they have put in. AKA, if they controlled the stock market like they used to, the market would be nearly as predictable as we are used to. \n\nWhat I think is not being accounted for is the exponential increase in retail investors. YTD retail investors have pumped the market with loads of cash and optimism. Retail has put in significantly more positive cash than institutions have negative. \n\nMaybe we need to think less about how the market has reacted in the past or what institutions think. But take more of a balanced approach, taking into consideration retail investors.\n\nHowever I'm not sure from where we would draw this retail investment consideration? From what I see on social media people are afraid of prices going up, tariffs, keeping their jobs and affording life basics. Not extra money to invest, let alone enough to sway markets.. However, accessibility is easier than ever. Online sports betting is a billion dollar business, investing is just as easy. Should we now consider hopium is the new leading default for retail investors and that retail money is stronger than institutional? ",
