Reddit,Boeing's record-breaking deal: Qatar Airways to buy up to 210 planes,"Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.

Qatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.

Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”

Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”

Reddit,"In my opinion, 06/19, CyberCab is released, and the world will know that Tesla is the second Enron","I am a long-term Chinese investor. I have been firmly bearish on Tesla for four years and have been laughed at by other investors for four years. But I am firm in my opinion because I am different from other investors. I have two undergraduate degrees in IT and economics, and I am also a mechanical enthusiast in my spare time. I understand mechanics, economics and IT better than others. I believe that the release date of Cybercab will be another Enron and Tesla's doomsday. How can it be achieved unless his good friend, the president, helps.

All the achievements of BEV today are based on government subsidies. In 2024, after the European government cancelled the BEV subsidies, the sales of hybrid and Toyota immediately increased. So when countries around the world gradually canceled the subsidies for electric vehicles in the next few years, who will buy them? Of course, the president's friends can ask the federal government to buy them at the government level.

Today, Tesla's market value is higher than Toyota, GM and Honda. This is really a joke.

Many people also told me that ""Tesla is not just a car company, it is the future, Mars, artificial intelligence, and innate intelligence. It will replace all humans.""

I don't want to discuss this topic with people who have no science and engineering background anymore. Really, there is a saying in China that ""if you don't cheat a fool's money, it's a waste."" These people are the same.

3. Will be broken up

This last point is fascinating to me because as I understand it, if it were to be broken up, shareholders would receive shares in all of the constituent parts.

Reddit,CoreWeave reports more than 400% growth in its first earnings,"Artificial intelligence infrastructure provider CoreWeave reported better-than-expected revenue on Wednesday in the company’s first earnings release since going public. The company reported revenue of $981.6 million, compared to expectations of $853 million, and -$1.49 EPS.

Revenue soared 420% in the quarter, which ended on March 31, from $188.7 million a year ago, according to a statement. That compares with 737% growth for all of 2024. The company’s net loss of $314.6 million widened from $129.2 million a year earlier, partly because of $177 million in stock-based compensation costs for awards tied to the initial public offering.

CoreWeave sees $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion in 2025 revenue, which implies a growth rate of 363%. That growth requires hefty capital expenditures. The company expects capex of $20 billion to $23 billion for the year. The range includes impact from OpenAI and other factors. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had anticipated $4.61 billion in full-year revenue.

Reddit,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains","Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.

Shares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.

Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.

Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.

In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”

“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”

Investors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.

Additionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.

Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.

Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.

The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.

The department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.

“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.

“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",2025-05-14 10:01:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmfxo2/saudi_arabia_plans_to_spend_billions_of_dollars/,2025-05-14,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains.

Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.

Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.

The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.

The department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.

“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.

“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",AMD,-0.023190650090253947,-1
Reddit,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains","Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.

Shares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.

Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.

Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.

In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”

“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”

Reddit,Microsoft is cutting 3% of all workers,"Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels and geographies.

“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

The company reported better-than-expected results and an upbeat quarterly forecast in late April.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees.

It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.

One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said.

On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July.

Reddit,Tesla Institutional Investor Movement- Mixed Bag- Mostly Positive,"I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the ""smart money"" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the ""smart money"" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.

From the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%. Additionally, the total number of institutional holders increased 1.75%, from 4020 to 4091. Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions. Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).

I don't have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.

*\*I assume these sales are politically motivated to some extent.*

Again, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).

My takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don't shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.",2025-05-14 13:15:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmks0z/tesla_institutional_investor_movement_mixed_bag/,2025-05-14,"Tesla Institutional Investor Movement- Mixed Bag- Mostly Positive.

Again, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).

My takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don't shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.",TSLA,-0.01397832907829855,-1

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

Reddit,The eToro IPO- Boom or Doom?,"[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.

**Why am I writing these?**

Because I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.

**What is eToro?**

eToro is a ""social trading"" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Launched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.

**Financial Performance**

|2024|$192M|3.5M|$304M|
|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|
|2022|\-$21M|2.8M|\-$43M|

**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**

**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  
**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  
**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  
**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.

**Global User Base**

Europe & UK: \~70% of funded accounts.  
Asia-Pacific: \~16%.  
Americas (U.S. + Latin America): \~10%.  
Middle East & Africa: \~4%.

eToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.

|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|
|Market Cap|\~$4B (IPO target)|\~$55B|\~$65B|\~$6B|

eToro’s valuation (\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.

**Risks:** The F-1 admits that ""Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets"", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and ""Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)"".

So during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. 

Another thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**

**Conclusion**

I don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.

eToro’s valuation (\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.

**Risks:** The F-1 admits that ""Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets"", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and ""Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)"".

So during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. 

Another thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**

**Conclusion**

I don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade.

Reddit,The eToro IPO- Boom or Doom?,"[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.

**Why am I writing these?**

Because I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.

**What is eToro?**

eToro is a ""social trading"" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Launched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.

**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.

Somewhat new investor, but I’ve never really  engaged with IPOs and I am confused.  

I decided I would take a cautious shot at Etoro (ETOR) which, according to the news, would debut today.  I see I am able to bid on the projected price…but the stock doesn’t appear to be trading.  When does the stock buy and sell as a normal stock?  It’s listed on NASDAQ Global Select.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

In addition to cooling, **uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)** and **power management systems** are essential in a region where power fluctuations and extreme temperatures can lead to outages.

Reddit,My DD on FLUT,"What's up fellow investors! After diving deep into Flutter Entertainment's financials, analyst ratings, and recent performance, I've put together this comprehensive DD for a buy position in FLUT

 Flutter Entertainment is the world's largest online sports betting and iGaming operator with a portfolio of leading brands including FanDuel, Betfair, Paddy Power, PokerStars, Sky Betting & Gaming, and Sportsbet. The company operates globally with particular strength in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, and Italy.

 Recent Financial Performance
Flutter just released their Q1 2025 results on May 7th, showing continued growth:

Revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $3.67 billion
Average Monthly Players grew 8% to 14.88 million
Net income of $335 million, compared to a net loss of $177 million in Q1 2024 (a 289% improvement)
Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $616 million
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 16.8%

Growth Projections
Analyst consensus for Flutter's growth is extremely bullish:

Revenue growth: 20.45% for FY2025 and 16.08% for FY2026
EPS growth: Dramatic improvement from $0.24 in FY2024 to $9.01 in FY2025 (3,652% increase) and $12.93 in FY2026 (43.6% increase)


Now I am might be an idiot but I have been following lot of other funds and this is their consensus on FLUT

Analyst Sentiment
The Wall Street consensus on FLUT is overwhelmingly positive:

21 analysts covering the stock
Consensus rating: ""Buy"" (20 Buy ratings, 1 Strong Buy rating)
Average price target: $306.28 (26.65% upside from current price)
Price target range: $247 to $350
Recent analyst actions include:

Barclays lowering target from $300 to $293 (May 8, 2025)
Macquarie maintaining Outperform with $340 target (May 8, 2025)
Needham reiterating Buy with $310 target (May 8, 2025)

The ATH in feb 14 was ~$300, so it's all pretty reasonable.

Reddit,"1 Year Later: Revisiting ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection?""","A year ago, I made a post called ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection? $FICO Analysis

[How much are you willing to pay for perfection? $FICO Analysis : r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dgvrzy/how_much_are_you_willing_to_pay_for_perfection/)

Since that post, $FICO has returned 60%, outperforming the SP500 (12%) by 48 pp.

My investment thesis has more or less stayed the same, both in the pros and the cons. We are halfway through the year so I'll have to use TTM data.

**What's changed in the past year:**

As I expected, FICO's revenue growth, net income growth, and margin expansion story has been intact.

TTM Revenue jumped 15% to $1.84B, TTM Net Income grew 20% to $0.57B, and EPS jumped 21.8% to $23.60.

For FY25, Management expects $1.98B Top line, GAAP Net Income to be $0.625B, with GAAP EPS to be $25.05.

**Balance Sheet:**

LT debt has expanded from $2.2B to $2.5B. Shares outstanding have declined 1.5% to 24.9 Million. Management has also announced a $1.5B senior note offering to retire older higher rate debt. I still do not enjoy the amount of leverage on the balance sheet but I'm not in charge of it. Their cash is mostly going towards share buybacks (1.1B repurchased in TTM) which is not that accretive given the multiple.

**PE:**

[Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/a7fV5Pu)

Incredibly enough, FICO has expanded from a 73 PE from my previous post to a 92 PE. To say this is rich is an understatement. The market is clearly pricing in massive margin expansion as well as safety due to no tarriff risk and minimal business failure due to their monopolistic power.

**Closing Remarks:**

I still believe FICO is the closest thing we have to a perfect business. People may believe VantageScore to be a possible disruptor but ultimately, if everyone is using something because they trust their metrics, why risk potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars from poor underwriting to save a few thousand bucks? FICO is still an amazing business, but the multiple leaves little to desire. I have not sold any of my position, nor have I added more given the very rich valuation.",2025-05-13 09:16:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kllo5f/1_year_later_revisiting_how_much_are_you_willing/,2025-05-13,"1 Year Later: Revisiting ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection?"".

LT debt has expanded from $2.2B to $2.5B. Shares outstanding have declined 1.5% to 24.9 Million. Management has also announced a $1.5B senior note offering to retire older higher rate debt. I still do not enjoy the amount of leverage on the balance sheet but I'm not in charge of it. Their cash is mostly going towards share buybacks (1.1B repurchased in TTM) which is not that accretive given the multiple.

**PE:**

[Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/a7fV5Pu)

Incredibly enough, FICO has expanded from a 73 PE from my previous post to a 92 PE. To say this is rich is an understatement. The market is clearly pricing in massive margin expansion as well as safety due to no tarriff risk and minimal business failure due to their monopolistic power.

**Closing Remarks:**

I still believe FICO is the closest thing we have to a perfect business. People may believe VantageScore to be a possible disruptor but ultimately, if everyone is using something because they trust their metrics, why risk potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars from poor underwriting to save a few thousand bucks? FICO is still an amazing business, but the multiple leaves little to desire. I have not sold any of my position, nor have I added more given the very rich valuation.",FICO,-0.004742502125056534,0

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-UnitedHealth Group announced the resignation of CEO Andrew Witty and suspended its 2025 financial outlook due to higher-than-expected medical costs, particularly in its Medicare Advantage segment. Stephen Hemsley, former CEO from 2006 to 2017, is returning to lead the company. The stock dropped nearly 11% in premarket trading. Extremely interested to see if we can break $335, otherwise not interested. Cost pressures were cited to be related to Medicare funding cuts.

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-China lifted a month-long ban on Boeing aircraft deliveries following trade negotiations with the United States, signaling improved relations and resumption of jet deliveries to China. The stock barely moved on this news, so not too interested unless we do some large selloff at the open (past $200). Other stocks related and defense companies didn't move significantly.

[**SE (Sea Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SE&p=d)\-Sea Limited reported adjusted earnings of $0.65 vs $0.60 exp, on revenue of $4.84B vs $4.91B. The company showed a nearly 30% year-over-year revenue growth. SE is one of my favorite ""international"" stocks, it started developing with mobile games and now is essentially a tech conglomerate. Mainly interested to see if it can hold up the momentum premarket, otherwise interested in a (very) small short.

[**ABNB (Airbnb)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ABNB&p=d)\-Airbnb's CEO is set to announce a significant development referred to as the ""next chapter"" for the company, details of which are pending. No technicals to speak off, but the travel/hospitality industry is highly vulnerable to tariffs/tourism, so interested to see what this ""next chapter"" will be.

Reddit,Thoughts on Block Inc. (NYSE:XYZ)?,"Hello

So Block inc. are the guys who own cashapp. On May 2nd they dipped drastically by almost 20% which was caused by their earnings report. I bought the dip at 47,71$ and May 13th close price was 58,17$. I have 105 stocks. 

So right now I’m up about 1200$ and this is the most money I have made by investing in such a short time as a young investor with about a year of experience. 

Is this stock a potential long term investment or should I cash in now? I’ve only held this for 5 business days. Things I’m worried about are this company’s next earnings report dipping the price again, but then again I bought at such a low price I don’t know if there is actually anything for me to lose by just holding.

Then of course I’m a little hesitant to do long term investments because I have no idea if Trump is gonna go crazy again with the tariffs…

>The technology giant’s shares were up 7% in premarket trading, tracking gains in the wider market after Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily slash the reciprocal tariffs on Monday. But Chinese imports will still be subject to a 30% levy in the U.S.

>Apple is among the most prominent firms caught in U.S.-China trade tensions, which intensified in recent months after a series of tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump.

>The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the WSJ report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

>Raising prices could help Apple cushion higher costs stemming from the tariffs that have hampered global supply chains and forced the company to shift more production to India.

>Apple said earlier this month that tariffs were expected to add about $900 million in costs during the April-June quarter and that it would source a majority of the iPhones sold in the U.S. in the period from India.

>Analysts have for months speculated about a price increase from Apple, but warned that such a move could cost it market share, especially as rivals such as Samsung try to attract consumers with AI features that Apple has been slow to roll out.  
  
The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142 due to tariffs, per projections last month from Rosenblatt Securities, which say the cost could rise by 43%.

Reddit,Megacap tech adds more than $800 billion in market cap after U.S.-China tariff pause,"Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

“With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,” Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.

“This morning is a huge win for the bulls and a best case scenario post this weekend in our view.”

Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

Reddit,Unexplored $GOOG Bull Case: Hedge against a post AGI world,"There are a lot of bull theses on Google discussed on this sub.  However, none of them touches on the biggest reason to buy $GOOG. 

A post-AGI world is envisioned below:

“machines possessing human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task a human can. This could lead to significant societal shifts, including widespread automation of jobs, potentially altering employment structures and requiring new economic models like Universal Basic Income (UBI)”

Moving further in time, we may even reach ASI and that’s when Singularity is conjectured to occur. But our focus should be on a post AGI world which we are actually currently heading towards.

A post AGI world is very likely to see lost of existing jobs to AI. The counter to this is UBI. However, there is no guarantee UBI will ever occur. This is why investing in $GOOG is highly beneficial to hedge against this possible scenario.

In a post AGI world, there may be many players who are able to provide AGI services. One of the most, if not the most, formidable existing players to gain a significant share of AGI is $GOOG. 

There could potentially be trillions of dollars worth of wages replaced by AGI. On top of that, AGI will likely be used to create even more goods and services than before AGI. Meaning, this could easily become a multi trillion dollar industry. 

Now, if we lose our jobs, and there is no sufficient UBI to raise our living standards, we can at least benefit from a significant increase in our $GOOG investment. 

That means it is a good idea to buy $GOOG even if you believe that Google Search will not be redesigned and gets decimated. View that as a hedge against a post AGI world that many are fearing would happen. A type of insurance. 

$GOOG is definitely one of the best players to invest in for such a scenario. There are just no other public listed companies that can actually go toe to toe against ChatGPT, even the other Mag 7 behemoths. And there are no other companies who has the full stack of technologies required to run a state of the art AI. 

$GOOG’s value is not just as a good business to own, but also as an insurance against a post AGI world.

“machines possessing human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task a human can. This could lead to significant societal shifts, including widespread automation of jobs, potentially altering employment structures and requiring new economic models like Universal Basic Income (UBI)”

Reddit,"OpenAI negotiates with Microsoft for new funding and future IPO, FT reports","May 11 (Reuters) - OpenAI and Microsoft are rewriting terms of their multibillion-dollar partnership in a negotiation designed to allow the ChatGPT maker to launch a future IPO, while protecting the software giant's access to cutting-edge AI models, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

A critical issue is how much equity in OpenAI’s new for-profit business Microsoft will receive in exchange for the more than $13 billion it has invested in the company to date, the report said. It said Microsoft is offering to give up some of its equity stake in exchange for access to new technology developed beyond the 2030 cutoff.

They are also revising terms of a wider contract, first drafted when Microsoft initially invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019, the report said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.OpenAI has told investors it will share a smaller fraction of revenue with its largest backer as it moves ahead with restructuring, The Information reported last week. In January, Microsoft changed some terms of a deal with OpenAI after entering a joint venture with Oracle and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new artificial intelligence data centers in the U.S.

I think it's going to hang around the $10 - $12 range for the next few years but will be worth a lot more in the future.

Is it dumb to DCA say $25/week of this stock for a few years with the intention of cashing out 10 - 15 years in the future when it's worth a lot more (this is a company that I think is undervalued now but will be worth a lot, long term ,in the future) or am I better off here at putting it into VOO?

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

Reddit,Is My Broker Stealing From Me?,"As an additional strategy, I have been watching for reverse split arbitrage opportunities. I've been doing this for about 18 months now, and while it's  typically only a few bucks each trade, it's better than nothing. The big boys game the system for profit, so why can't I? 

How I do this is I'll scan a daily list announcing upcoming splits. I filter for reverse splits, then read the company filing for how they treat fractional shares. If they say they will round up, then I purchase one share and wait. This has worked well for me for the first year, but not anymore. Aside from the fact that less issuers are rounding up, my broker keeps paying me cash in lieu of.

I know that corporate actions are processed according to instructions given to the DTC from the issuer and can be at the participant or beneficial holder level. The majority of tickers I've done this with state something like, ""stockholders that own shares in street name with a broker or bank will be treated the same as those that hold registered shares in book-entrty form.""

This tells me that if fractional shares are to be rounded up, then I should get one whole share. How do I, or anyone for that matter, know if the broker is not collecting all the whole shares that belong to the clients and just payout the fractional amount in cash? 

I have asked, through customer support chats because getting someone on the phone is difficult at best, and the answer I get is always that ""cash is paid in lieu of fractional shares.""

Reddit,Trump has threatened to place a 100% tariff on Barbie maker Mattel,"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-threatens-barbie-100-percent-tariff-2070023

> President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports. ""I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' "" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market."" Trump's threat to Mattel comes as toys—in particular dolls—have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy.

> Trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers.

> During the company's first-quarter earnings call, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three ""mitigating actions"" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on China-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain.

> President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports. ""I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' "" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market."" Trump's threat to Mattel comes as toys—in particular dolls—have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy.

> Trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers.

> During the company's first-quarter earnings call, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three ""mitigating actions"" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on China-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain.

Reddit,CrowdStrike Faces Federal Investigation: Stock Tumbles Amid Government Probe into $32M IRS Deal,"CrowdStrike, a leading name in cybersecurity, saw its stock tumble this week following reports of a federal investigation into a major government contract. The probe centers around a $32 million software deal tied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), sparking investor concerns about the company’s business practices and future government partnerships.

According to sources close to the matter, the Department of the Treasury’s inspector general is investigating the role [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) played in a procurement process that allegedly skipped competitive bidding rules. The deal was executed through Carahsoft, a major government IT contractor, and involved CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software being fast-tracked into IRS systems.

The issue? Investigators are trying to determine if the deal improperly bypassed [federal acquisition regulations](https://www.acquisition.gov/), which require fair competition for most government contracts. So far, no formal accusations have been made, but the existence of an active investigation is enough to rattle stakeholders.

Once news of the probe broke, CrowdStrike’s stock dropped by nearly 5% in intraday trading. The sharp decline reflects investor anxiety over potential reputational damage, contract delays, or future revenue losses tied to government scrutiny.

This development comes at a time when CrowdStrike is viewed as a major player in protecting public and private institutions from cyber threats. Any disruption to that perception could shift market dynamics in favor of competitors.

# What This Means for the Cybersecurity Industry

Government contracts are a huge revenue source for cybersecurity firms. But as this situation highlights, they can also come with regulatory risks. The scrutiny CrowdStrike now faces serves as a warning to other tech firms: follow proper procurement procedures, or face financial and legal consequences.

Analysts say this probe might not spell long-term doom for CrowdStrike, especially if no wrongdoing is ultimately found. Still, it’s a reminder that trust and transparency are as critical as innovation in today’s tech-driven economy.",2025-05-09 19:14:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kiw51u/crowdstrike_faces_federal_investigation_stock/,2025-05-09,"CrowdStrike Faces Federal Investigation: Stock Tumbles Amid Government Probe into $32M IRS Deal.

This **leaves approximately 10% EBITDA** for a well-run retail company.

Now, even if you take the best-case scenario—**a 10% tariff on all imports** (which is what even the UK has after its ""historic"" deal with the US)—that 45% cost becomes **49.5%** (**45 × 1.1**), reducing retail companies’ EBITDA to approximately  under **6%**.

However, not all retail companies in the US are healthy—**many are on the brink of bankruptcy with average EBITDA under 7%**. Even Walmart, a volume-driven company and considered one of the healthiest low-cost retailers in the world, has an EBITDA of approximately **6%**. 

And now, **who still thinks we aren't headed for a recession in Q2 and Q3?** When do you think orders are placed for Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas? **Six months in advance.** And here we are, holding all orders or even if placing orders now with goods sitting in Chinese warehouses instead of being **in transit** as they should be.

You will not only see **fewer products on shelves**, but also **reduced consumer spending and layoffs**.

Reddit,Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies — its earnings multiple is astronomical,"There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.

“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”

There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.

There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Reddit,Land 156 - Mission Syracuse - Droneshield?,"**With both Mission Syracuse and LAND 156 gaining traction, which defence companies are best placed to win short-term contracts in counter-drone and force protection technologies?**

Mission Syracuse, led by the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator (ASCA), is actively sourcing deployable counter-UAS capabilities to protect ADF personnel, especially in contested or forward-deployed environments.

LAND 156 is the Army's modernization program focused on improving close combat effectiveness, including soldier protection, situational awareness, and survivability, domains where electronic warfare, drone defence, and integrated sensing are increasingly central.

Looking for thoughts on which Australian or allied defence players (including smaller or dual-use tech firms) are realistically positioned to secure contracts in the near term, especially those with field-ready solutions or existing ADF relationships. My guess on purely australian plays are EOS and Droneshield. Do I miss some companies? Any DD, signals, or educated speculation appreciated.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* Farley singled out imports from Japan and South Korea that have little to no duties compared with the 25% tariff President Donald Trump has threatened Canada and Mexico with in recent weeks.

Reddit,Swede here I'm short Tesla,"So their earnings were bad 
Brand is in the toilet 

The consumer base that bought these cars 
now would rather burn them 

Large drops in sales in the whole world. 

Recall on almost the whole Cybertruck fleet. 

A CEO that wants a 30 billion dollar payday? Spent the last 6 months burning the brand to the ground. 

Sells 5% of the cars in the world has half of the total market share of all auto companies in the world 

Other brands like BYD, VW etc having better tech, cars and batteries.

Looming Tarrifs on everything that Tesla needs to build cars. 

A new Semi expansion in a market where shipping to the US is down 39% and won't get up unless all Tarrifs just go away. Also with no infrastructure to support it and a administration that has no plans to spend a dime on EV infrastructure. 

Millions of self-driving taxis by second half of 2026? What? 

It's up 23% over the last month, can someone explain this to me? Now my bearish bet is 1 July price target $220 anything close to it and I'm green, under and I'm minted. 

Should I just eat the loss and move on? It's probably going to smack into $290 and go down again but still. 

Toyota is admitting it's going to be harsh sailing. Yet this barge of unmitigated disaster somehow is up?

Reddit,BREAKING: Trump to Rescind Chip Curbs After Debate Over AI Rules,"The Trump administration plans to rescind Biden-era AI chip curbs as part of a broader effort to revise semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn strong opposition from major tech companies and foreign governments, according to people familiar with the matter.

The repeal, which is not yet final, seeks to refashion a policy launched under President Joe Biden that created three broad tiers of countries for regulating the export of chips from Nvidia Corp. and others. The Trump administration will not enforce the so-called AI diffusion rule when it takes effect on May 15, the people said.

All Chip/Semiconductors will rally hard until China meeting this week. Get your lubes ready bears! All jokes aside, we might actually see 600 if talks go well this week as Trump just rescinded some of the chip tariffs probably to ease tensions before talking with Chinese counterparts.

Reddit,Got the biggest kick to my psyche's nuts in perhaps my entire life,"My mother recently passed and my dad is hanging on in memory care. I'm now running the family trust and so know all of my parent's holdings. Anyways I was going through copious amounts of files and yesterday finally took a closer look at a letter my dad wrote to us on 1/15/2007 before a trip they took up the Amazon, in case something bad happened I could start getting at the money. He provided a printout of all his stock and fund holdings and accounts and two positions really stood out. 

3100 shares of NFLX (~$70k)
1600 shares of NVDA. (~$56k)

We don't own either of those in the trust. Sold at some point perhaps years ago definitely before the extreme run-ups of the 2020's. Probably sold after making several hundred thousand or when they didn't move the right direction.

Today these holdings would be 

21,700 shares of NFLX at $1140 = $24.738 million
96,000 shares of NVDA at $116.65 = $11.198 million


Lesson is don't sell unless you absolutely have to and consider selling smaller chunks versus all or nothing.

Reddit,Why rocketlab is so hard under-hyped?,"
Im a big Fan of rocket lab and have about 700 shares and continue buying it every month for 2000 Euro. I also have other stocks but this is my gem. I love the CEO, the Team the Vision. But I think its so hard under-hyped. Everyone is talking about spaceX but first I cannot buy Stocks from spaceX and second the main goal of spaceX is in my eyes NOT making money. Its bringing people to Mars. And I mean its a cool goal ans I really Love the idea but beside of selling Mars properties or so I dont see that musk even wanna make money with SpaceX. His Goal is Mars. But rocketlab:
- is a company listed on the Stock Market (so WE can participate)
- its goal is business/making Money

So how can rocketlab make lot of money in Future? I think they will mine ressources from asteroids. So while musk travel to Mars and burn billions with SpaceX, rocketlab will make billions with mined Minerals from Asteroids some day... I HODL this Stock for decades and Im Sure this Stock will hit trillions of Market Cap in 20-30 years... Thats why I invest every month in it. 

Whats your opinion about that?

Reddit,Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL),"We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. 

I'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just ""Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars."" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... 

I'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! 

Edit: I'll start with mine. 

Search- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.

YouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.

Cloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. 

Google networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.

Other -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?

Balance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? 

So, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time.

Reddit,Nintendo forecasts sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles as it gears up for launch,"Nintendo said Thursday that it expects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026.

It is the first forecast for sales from the Japanese gaming giant since it announced the successor to its successful Switch device, which is due to go on sale in June.

Nintendo also reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full year. Here’s how Nintendo did in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Mar. 31 versus LSEG estimates:

* **Revenue**: 208.7 billion Japanese yen ($1.45 billion), compared with 216.16 billion yen expected.
* **Net profit:** 41.6 billion yen, versus 33.91 billion yen expected.

Revenue fell 24.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, while profit plunged nearly 50%. This was largely expected as Nintendo fans await the Switch 2 and hold off on buying the current console.

Earlier this year Nintendo slashed its forecast for sales of the Switch to 11 million units for the year ended Mar. 31. Nintendo on Thursday said it sold 10.8 million units of the Switch in the year, just shy of its own forecast and down 31% year-on-year.

Market research firm Omdia expects Nintendo to sell 14.7 million Switch 2 units in 2025 alone, which would be about 10% ahead of the original Switch’s debut year.

“Switch 2 will launch into a stronger position than its predecessor, with over 100 million active Switch users providing a strong foundation for adoption,” George Jijiashvili, Omdia’s senior principal analyst, told CNBC by email.

# Tariffs in focus

Investors are also focused on Nintendo’s forecast for the fiscal year. The company expects net sales of 1.9 trillion yen, a 63% year-on-year rise but just short of LSEG estimates of 2 trillion yen. It expects net profit to jump 7.6% to 300 billion yen, below LSEG estimates of 388.8 billion yen.

However, Nintendo noted that all of its forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective Apr. 10 — following a pause in U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs for many countries.

Nintendo in April delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. Nintendo’s consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, which faces duties of 46% once the pause lifts.

Nintendo’s President Shuntaro Furukawa said on Thursday that if additional tariffs are imposed and prices of its goods need to be adjusted, demand in the U.S. may decrease, Reuters reported. Duties could hit profit to the tune of tens of billions of yen, Furukawa added, according to the report.

Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games, said Nintendo’s forecasts are typically conservative.

“Nintendo loves lowballing their forecasts, and the current climate around tariffs gives them all the reason to be more cautious than ever,” Toto told CNBC.

He added that tariffs are creating an “unclear future” for Nintendo, making it “impossible” for any hardware maker to make sales predictions.

“What happens if the tariffs on imports from China stay this high for longer or if they are raised for Vietnam?” Toto said.

“If Nintendo needed to raise prices by $100 or more, all bets would be off and the company would be under enormous pressure in the all important U.S. market.”

# Switch 2 fuels stock rally

Investors are now focused on how the successor to the console, the Switch 2, will perform following its launch. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and has improved features compared with its predecessor.

As well as the 15 million unit sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, Nintendo said it expects to sell 45 million units of software during the same period.

Games are important for the success of any console and Nintendo said the Switch 2 will launch with two titles — “Mario Kart World” and “Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour.” There will also be Switch 2 versions of existing games such as “Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Nintendo is leaning on its popular characters such as Mario and Zelda to boost the appeal of the Switch 2.

Nintendo first launched the original Switch in 2017 and it has become the Japanese gaming giant’s second-best-selling console ever with over 150 million units sold. The firm managed to extend the life of the hardware thanks to hit games involving characters like Super Mario, franchises such as Pokemon and the expansion of its intellectual property into films.

Investors are hopeful the company can continue to ride its wave of popularity with shares up around 30% this year and 64% over the past 12 months.

Reddit,Warner Bros Discovery misses revenue estimates on box office weakness,"https://stocks.apple.com/AV2Irp1ZHQ2eG8M_0a9BnNg

Summary
Quarterly studios revenue declines 18% after 'Mickey 17' underperforms
Streaming subscriber gains of 5.3 million far exceed estimates
Cable TV unit revenue falls 7% as cord-cutting continues
Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) missed first-quarter revenue estimates on Thursday, weighed down by a lack of big box office hits from its studios and weakness in its traditional TV business as consumers continued to abandon cable for streaming.
Like others in the media business, Warner Bros Discovery is losing thousands of cable TV subscribers each year, putting pressure on the company to consistently produce hit content and boost profitability in its streaming business.
The threat of U.S. tariffs on foreign-made films has also added to the headaches of an industry whose biggest-budget films are often produced across several continents.
WBD struggled in the January-March quarter to replicate the success of last year's ""Dune: Part Two,"" which grossed more than $700 million. The company's marquee release for the period, Bong Joon Ho's sci-fi dark comedy ""Mickey 17,"" earned only slightly more than its reported budget at the box office.
That meant studios revenue fell 18% to $2.31 billion, missing estimates of $2.73 billion, according to Visible Alpha.
The company has, however, made a strong start to the second quarter with Ryan Coogler's horror film ""Sinners"" and the blockbuster ""A Minecraft Movie,"" which has raked in around $900 million globally, making it the biggest release of 2025 so far. Its summer lineup also looks strong with ""Superman,"" directed by Marvel's long-time hitmaker James Gunn, set to release in July.
Revenue at the TV networks segment, which includes CNN, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, fell 7%, with advertising revenue in the business declining 12% as marketers avoided cable TV amid cord-cutting by subscribers.
Overall, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of 2025 to $8.98 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $9.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Loss of 18 cents per share was also larger than expectations for a 13-cent loss, even as costs declined 11.8%.
The company's shares were down 1.9% in premarket trading.
Still, its streaming business was a bright spot.
WBD added 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, compared with 3.1 million estimated by analysts, according to Visible Alpha, taking its total to 122.3 million. The quarter featured some strong content slate including the third season of HBO's ""The White Lotus"" and the medical drama series ""The Pitt"".
The company also launched its Max streaming service in Australia earlier this year, following rollouts in more than 70 countries across Europe and Asia last year. Analysts say it has also benefited and reduced churn thanks to a streaming bundle combining Disney+, Hulu and Max that was introduced last year.

The quarter featured some strong content slate including the third season of HBO's ""The White Lotus"" and the medical drama series ""The Pitt"".
The company also launched its Max streaming service in Australia earlier this year, following rollouts in more than 70 countries across Europe and Asia last year. Analysts say it has also benefited and reduced churn thanks to a streaming bundle combining Disney+, Hulu and Max that was introduced last year.

Reddit,How does inflow/ outflow work?,"I am trying to learn and understand how inflows and outflows technically work and how they relate to the underlying price and changes therewithin. for example SPY had net outflows during periods it increased in price and net inflows as it was decreasing in price.

how is this possible and how would it work? how could there technically even be inflows or outflows of $ if every transaction includes a buy and a sell, technically wouldnt it be even, ie if i buy spy at $570, someone must be selling it at $570 so there shouldnt be any money going in or out ?

  
\* reddit cut off the rest of my question:

and if that means simply when i buy its a net inflow of $570, why would the price move upwards on days where there are net OUT flows and move down on days where there are net inflows? i am not getting how this is possible.

Reddit,Cathie Wood on CNBC this morning,"Just watched Andrew Ross Sorkin’s interview with Cathie Wood who manages the ARK Fund. The segment was about “finding opportunity”. Her optimism about Tesla, Bitcoin, and this administration’s approach to tariffs and global tax cuts was so positive that I questioned her credibility. Here are some highlights of the interview.

She spoke of all “the letters” her firm puts out. Highlights:

1. Says we are in recession now and sees end of rolling recession very soon
2. Govt Productivity increase is staggering
3. Palintir - recent report was “fantastic”. strategic decision for companies and growing although Europe is slow on uptake of AI. Alex Karp said Europe is hopeless. But maybe that changes she says. I own Palintir stock. 
4. Bitcoin new target (2030) - $750k to $1.5 M. Might replace Gold as hedge. Wow!
5. Tesla- $2600 by 2030. What? Robots, Energy Storage, and AI
6. Google News re AI and models take share from Google. She thinks Google is underestimating the negative impact to them

She expects interest rates to come down. Bullish overall.

Reddit,Trump to Rescind Global AI Curbs,"From Bloomberg:

The Trump administration plans to rescind some Biden-era AI chip curbs as part of a broader effort to revise global semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn strong opposition from major tech companies and foreign governments.

The repeal of the so-called AI diffusion rule, which is not yet final, seeks to refashion a policy launched under President Joe Biden that created three broad tiers of countries for regulating the export of chips from Nvidia Corp. and others. The Trump administration will not enforce that framework when it takes effect on May 15, according to people familiar with the matter, and is instead drafting its own version of the rules that’s likely to focus on direct negotiations with nations like the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia.

The policy debate, which remains ongoing, centers on the question of how to regulate semiconductor shipments to places outside of China. Both Trump and Biden officials have sought to crack down on Beijing’s semiconductor ambitions, over concerns that advanced chip and AI technology could lend China a military edge. 

Scrapping the AI diffusion framework won’t change the measures targeting China, which Trump recently toughened. Rather, it would provide fresh opportunities for other countries to negotiate their own chip access, as governments around the world seek to develop domestic AI capabilities. Those deals could be influenced by investment promises or broader trade and diplomatic considerations.

Reddit,ROOT & CVNA Monster ER beat?,"So Carvana & ROOT both reported yesterday with monster earnings.

  
CVNA reported 4.23B in revenue beating revenue estimates of 4B

and CVNA earnings was reported at 1.53 EPS versus .75 EPS, a near 104.66% beat.

  
On the surface earnings look incredible but with a closer look CVNA has reported 158M in NI from ROOT warrants. Thats 278 million collectively that CVNA has now recorded in ROOT warrant gains. The 373M net income was padded. though, regardless the earnings seem pretty solid.  

  
so my thought is, with ROOT's monster earnings announced yesterday with a 4000%+ beat in EPS and 42M+ rev beat, 80m QoQ growth in written premiums, the accounting of warrants by CVNA,  and the suspicious shelf offering announced in q1, it feels like CVNA may be gearing up to exercise those 180-216 warrants. if that is the case, shouldn't we see ROOT trade significantly higher than 216 soon? what do you guys think?",2025-05-08 06:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1khmjja/root_cvna_monster_er_beat/,2025-05-08,"ROOT & CVNA Monster ER beat?.

so my thought is, with ROOT's monster earnings announced yesterday with a 4000%+ beat in EPS and 42M+ rev beat, 80m QoQ growth in written premiums, the accounting of warrants by CVNA,  and the suspicious shelf offering announced in q1, it feels like CVNA may be gearing up to exercise those 180-216 warrants. if that is the case, shouldn't we see ROOT trade significantly higher than 216 soon? what do you guys think?",ROOT,0.04191103573084356,1

Reddit,Thoughts on $HIMS,"This is now retails hot stock next to Palantir, Tesla and MSTR. For background they offer personalized telehealth services and offer medications for hair loss, sexual health and weight loss through GLP-1s.

The problem I see is their Moat. They have to spend lots of money on advertising to attract customers due to competition such as Ro. Customer acquisition costs is high but customer switching costs is minimal. There are probably dozens of other telehealth provider competing for the same product offerings. They sell generic drugs that a thousand other pharmacies make. Overall it's very similar to Netflix which takes other peoples products and places them in a glamorous digital online platform. They do not make drugs 💊 and thus have no competitive advantage from patents or IP. 



Their compounded glp business is controversial and rightfully so given that they are profiting off billions of dollars spent for R&D from Lilly and Novo. It is a recipe for litigation. The only reason Novo partnered with Hims is due to most of the margins going to them (I assume so, otherwise it makes no sense). The only way I see HIMS becoming successful is actually delivering perfect, frictionless services as smooth as Amazon prime.

A little over a decade ago people were calling the handheld market, a market that they led, dead due to mobile, the WII U was failure and the 3DS was selling half of the DS. The company lost money for 3 years straight and people predicted that they would follow SEGA and go third party. Instead of doing what most companies do, their CEO, the late great Satoru Iwata took a pay cut of 50%, did not layoff anyone and focused on revolutionizing the market again with the ""hybrid"" known at the time as the NX. 

They caved to shareholders by creating games for mobile, but they never truly explored the market. They did that to give them a breathing room while they focused on their magnus opus. Iwata died in the midst of that due to cancer, but the new leadership stuck with the plan. 

10 years later, the NX, now known as Switch, revolutionized the gaming industry, revitalized the handheld market and is about to surpass the PS2 as the best selling console of all time. They are almost completely out of mobile and were never as big. Mario was the most profitable movie of 2023, Zelda is bigger than ever and will have a new movie in 2 years.

Reddit,Arm shares drop on weak forecast,"Arm shares dropped more than 8% in extended trading on Wednesday after the chip-design company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with LSEG consensus:

* Earnings per share: 55 cents, adjusted vs. 52 cents expected
* Revenue: $1.24 billion vs. $1.23 billion

While Arm topped estimates for the quarter ended March 31, Wall Street is looking ahead to the company’s forecast for the first quarter.

Arm said revenue will be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. The middle of the range is below the $1.1 billion average analysts estimated, according to LSEG. Earnings per share will be between 30 cents and 38 cents, while analysts were expecting 42 cents.

SoftBank controls about 90% of Arm, and took the company public in 2023. It now has a market cap of over $130 billion as of Wednesday’s close.

Arm designs the fundamental architecture upon which many chips are built, and sells licenses for its designs to companies such as Qualcomm and Nvidia, charging royalty fees on each sale they make. The company claims 99% of premium smartphones are powered by Arm technology.

Royalty revenue in the quarter rose 18% from a year earlier to $607 million.

Net income fell 6% to $210 million, or 20 cents a share, from $224 million, or 21 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue jumped 34% from $928 million a year earlier.

Arm said revenue will be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. The middle of the range is below the $1.1 billion average analysts estimated, according to LSEG. Earnings per share will be between 30 cents and 38 cents, while analysts were expecting 42 cents.

SoftBank controls about 90% of Arm, and took the company public in 2023. It now has a market cap of over $130 billion as of Wednesday’s close.

Arm designs the fundamental architecture upon which many chips are built, and sells licenses for its designs to companies such as Qualcomm and Nvidia, charging royalty fees on each sale they make. The company claims 99% of premium smartphones are powered by Arm technology.

Royalty revenue in the quarter rose 18% from a year earlier to $607 million.

Net income fell 6% to $210 million, or 20 cents a share, from $224 million, or 21 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue jumped 34% from $928 million a year earlier.

Reddit,Amazon buys the dip in AMD shares as per their 13F Filing,"Looks like Amazon just made a move on AMD. According to their latest 13F filing, they acquired 822,234 shares, valued at around $84.4 million.

Interesting timing, especially with AMD ramping up its AI chip game and pushing deeper into data centers. Feels like Amazon might be hedging its bets or maybe doubling down on AI infrastructure for AWS.

With all the recent volatility in semiconductors, maybe Amazon sees this as an opportunity to grab strong positioning while others are selling off.

What do you guys think? Smart move or just another corporate hedge?

Reddit,Uber misses revenue expectations with trips up 18% over last year,"Uber reported first-quarter results Wednesday that beat analysts’ expectations for earnings, but fell shy of anticipated revenue growth for the quarter. Shares fell about 5% following the report.

Here’s how Uber did versus analysts’ estimates compiled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 83 cents vs. 50 cents expected.
* **Revenue:** $11.53 billion vs. $11.62 billion expected.

Revenue at the ride-sharing company grew about 14% in the first three months of 2025, up from $10.13 billion during the same period in 2024.

The company also reported net income of around $1.78 billion or 83 cents per share during the first three months of 2025, up from a net loss of $654 million, or a loss of 32-cent loss per share, during the first quarter of 2024.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and CFO ‭Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said they expect gross bookings to reach between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion during the current quarter, with EBITDA in the range of $2.02 billion to $2.12 billion for that period.

In April, the Federal Trade Commission sued Uber and accused the company of “deceptive billing and cancellation practices” around its subscription service called Uber One.

“It’s a bit of a head-scratcher for us,” Khosrowshahi told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.

He said 60% of the company’s gross bookings in its Uber Eats business come from Uber One members, and that the subscription service is growing quickly.

“The suit alleges that some people don’t realize that they’re signing up or cancellations are difficult, but I’d encourage you to go experience it yourself,” Khosrowshahi said. “It’s very, very simple. You take a couple of steps to be able to cancel if you want.”

Uber’s largest business segments, which include its ride-hailing business and food and grocery delivery service, saw bookings increase year-over-year.

Here are the key segment numbers:

* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $21.18 billion, up 13% year over year
* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $20.38 billion, up 15% year over year

The company also said its “monthly active platform consumers,” had grown to 170 million, up 14% from the first quarter of last year. Users booked around 3.04 billion “trips” during the first quarter of 2025, up 18% from the first quarter of 2024.

Uber told employees at the end of April that they would have to come into the office three days a week instead of two, including some remote staffers. The company also announced changes to its month-long paid sabbatical benefit, raising the requirement from five years at the company to eight years. 

Khosrowshahi defended the policy changes at a heated all-hands meeting last week, as CNBC previously reported.

“Our company is executing really well, but we need to be at our top of our game and that means people working together in the office,” he told CNBC on Wednesday.

Uber has also been making a push into autonomous vehicles, or AV technology. Khosrowshahi said the company views AVs as “the single greatest opportunity ahead for Uber.”

Uber allows app users to book robotaxi rides in some U.S. markets, or order food for delivery via autonomous vehicle in others.

Khosrowshahi said Uber reached an “annual run-rate” of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.

In March, the company began to offer users in Austin, Texas the option to hail a robotaxi from its partner, Alphabet-owned Waymo exclusively via the Uber platform.

Khosrowshahi said the Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as far as completed trips per day.

Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta.

“Supported by the consistent strength of our core business, we continue to build towards the future, including five new autonomous vehicle announcements in just the last week,” Khosrowshahi said in a release.

The company upped some of its fiscal 2025 guidance and posted revenue growth in all three of its business segments.

Shares of Disney gained about 6% in premarket trading Wednesday.

Disney, which had previously said it expected Disney+ subscribers to decline during the quarter, reported a 1.4 million increase in subscriptions to its flagship service, bringing its global base to 126 million. Wall Street had expected Disney to report 123.35 million Disney+ subscribers, according to StreetAccount. 

Disney expects a modest rise in these subscribers in its current quarter.

Revenue for its direct-to-consumer business rose to $6.12 billion, up 8% compared with the same period a year prior. Higher prices and increased subscriber numbers led to the growth, the company said.

Here is what Disney reported for the period ended March 29 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.45 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected
* **Revenue:** $23.62 billion vs. $23.14 billion

Disney now expects full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75, an increase of 16% compared with fiscal 2024. Previously, the company said it expected high-single-digit adjusted EPS growth.

Disney’s net income for the most recent quarter increased to $3.28 billion, or $1.81 per share, up from a loss of $20 million, or a loss of 1 cent per share, during the same quarter last year.

Adjusting for one-time items, including the resolution of a tax matter, among other items, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.45. 

Disney’s overall revenue was up 7% year over year to $23.62 billion.

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks, direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 9% year over year to $10.68 billion after a strong carryover from winter film titles.

While “Snow White” and “Captain America: Brave New World” underperformed, ticket sales from 2024 releases “Mufasa: The Lion King” and “Moana 2″ buoyed content sales and licensing. 

Linear continued to drag on overall results, with revenue falling 13% to $2.42 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, rose 5% to $4.53 billion on higher advertising revenue. The company aired three additional College Football Playoff games and one extra National Football League game during the quarter, leading to higher ad rates and viewership.

For fiscal 2025, Disney said Wednesday it expects its sports segment’s operating income growth will be up 18% year over year, higher than the 13% growth it had previously forecast.

Over at its experiences business, which includes parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products, revenue rose 6% during the quarter to $8.89 billion.

Its domestic theme parks saw revenue rise 9% to $6.5 billion, while international park revenues dipped 5% to $1.44 billion.

The company attributed revenue gains to higher guest spend at its domestic parks and higher volumes on its cruise ships following the launch of the Disney Treasure.

Its consumer products division saw revenue up 4% to $949 million due to higher licensing revenue from the newly released video game Marvel Rivals.

Reddit,AMD earnings beat as overall sales surge 36%,"Advanced Micro Devices reported first fiscal-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped expectations, and provided a strong forecast for current-quarter revenue.

Shares of AMD rose more than 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended March 29:

* **Earnings per share**: 96 cents adjusted vs. 94 cents expected
* **Revenue**: $7.44 billion vs. $7.13 billion expected

For the current quarter, AMD expects about $7.4 billion in sales with a gross margin of 43%, versus Wall Street estimates for earnings of 86 cents adjusted on $7.25 billion in sales.

AMD’s forecast also included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company’s artificial intelligence chips during the quarter.

The company reported net income of $709 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, versus net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 36% on an annual basis.

AMD is the second-place server central processing unit vendor, behind Intel, but its Epyc line of processors has been taking market share in recent years.

The company is also the closest competitor to Nvidia for “big GPUs,” or graphics processing units. Those are the kind of chips that are deployed in data centers by the thousands for building generative AI. It did $5 billion in AI GPU sales in the company’s fiscal 2024.

Both are reported in the company’s data center segment, which came in at $3.7 billion in sales, topping a StreetAccount estimate. Data center sales were up 57% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.

The company’s other major segment, Client and Gaming, includes chips for consumer devices such as laptops, gaming PCs and game consoles. The overall segment rose 28% on an annual basis to $2.9 billion. AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.

Gaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.

AMD’s embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company’s 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.

The overall segment rose 28% on an annual basis to $2.9 billion. AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.

Gaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.

AMD’s embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company’s 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.

Advanced Micro Devices reported first fiscal-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped expectations, and provided a strong forecast for current-quarter revenue.

Shares of AMD rose more than 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended March 29:

* **Earnings per share**: 96 cents adjusted vs. 94 cents expected
* **Revenue**: $7.44 billion vs. $7.13 billion expected

For the current quarter, AMD expects about $7.4 billion in sales with a gross margin of 43%, versus Wall Street estimates for earnings of 86 cents adjusted on $7.25 billion in sales.

AMD’s forecast also included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company’s artificial intelligence chips during the quarter.

The company reported net income of $709 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, versus net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 36% on an annual basis.

AMD is the second-place server central processing unit vendor, behind Intel, but its Epyc line of processors has been taking market share in recent years.

The company is also the closest competitor to Nvidia for “big GPUs,” or graphics processing units. Those are the kind of chips that are deployed in data centers by the thousands for building generative AI. It did $5 billion in AI GPU sales in the company’s fiscal 2024.

Both are reported in the company’s data center segment, which came in at $3.7 billion in sales, topping a StreetAccount estimate. Data center sales were up 57% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.

[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.62 vs. $0.61 expected and revenue of $5.47B vs. $5.46B expected. AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.

[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d)\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.

Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.

[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d)\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday’s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff.

Streaming pioneer Netflix could particularly be at risk, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares slumped 4.9% in premarket trading, leading a slide in media stocks.

Reddit,Ford suspends 2025 guidance amid $2.5 billion tariff impact,">DETROIT – Ford Motor beat Wall Street’s first-quarter expectations, but suspended its 2025 financial guidance amid an expected $2.5 billion impact this year from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

>The Detroit automaker said it expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions as well as volume and pricing expectations for a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025.

>Ford cited “near-term risks, especially the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption impacting production” and the potential for future or increased tariffs in the U.S., among other potential impacts such as retaliatory tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance.

>The tariff impact is notably less than the $4 billion to $5 billion that General Motors said it expected to incur as a result of Trump’s tariffs, as Ford imports fewer vehicles than its crosstown rival. GM said it expected to offset at least 30% of those expenses.

Looks like Ford is not providing guidance for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.

Reddit,"Comcast’s cable spinoff to be named Versant, picked to emphasize corporate versatility","Comcast’s spinoff of the majority of its NBCUniversal cable network portfolio will be named Versant, the company said Tuesday, ending a months-long process to select a new corporate moniker.

The new company chose Versant (pronounced like the root of the word conversant) to emphasize its versatility and its familiarity with multiple subjects, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Lazarus, who spoke in an interview. Versant, which had been called SpinCo until a permanent name was chose, will own cable networks including USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel. It will also house digital assets Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow, GolfPass and SportsEngine.

The rest of Comcast’s NBCUniversal portfolio, including the broadcast network, Peacock streaming service, Universal Studios, the theme parks and Bravo, will remain with Comcast.

The new name itself isn’t meant to be consumer-facing. Lazarus wants Versant to be viewed as a house of brands, with each individual asset interacting with users rather than the corporate holding entity.

“We’re going to focus on the individual brands that we have, not the corporate name,” Lazarus said. “This is a holding company name. It’s going to be used for business-to-business purposes.”

Versant is on track to be spun out from Comcast before the end of 2025, Lazarus confirmed. The assets held by the new company generated about $7 billion in revenue last year.

The company’s emphasis on versatility is notable given the rapidly changing media ecosystem. Lazarus will need to build a Wall Street growth narrative for investors once the company starts trading publicly. That will include making acquisitions to build on the company’s core. Some of those transactions may step outside pure media plays, he said.

Lazarus cited Golf Channel’s acquisition of GolfNow, a tee-time reservation company, as an example of how the brands can move beyond linear TV and streaming to build profitable businesses.

“Most people don’t know that GolfNow is even part of our company,” Lazarus said. “We are not going to be purely a collection of linear and digital media assets.”

For a brand such as CNBC, that may include acquiring personal finance or fintech platforms, Lazarus said. For MSNBC, Lazarus said he’s already had some preliminary conversations about potentially buying podcasts that cater to Democrats. He noted if he were to make such an acquisition, the plan wouldn’t be to put that programming on air for MSNBC, but to have it operate as a separate business unit using the cable network as a marketing funnel.

Versant will not launch its own streaming service, Lazarus said. It will instead rely on brands to develop their own digital strategies.

About 20% of the company’s revenue is already digital in nature, Lazarus said. Versant is also likely to return money to shareholders via a dividend, CNBC reported in November.

One strategy the company isn’t likely to pursue is to acquire a group of cable networks.

Lazarus said he has little interest in accumulating more debt attached to low-growth assets. If a cable network also had associated businesses that had better growth prospects, that could be more appealing on a case-by-case basis, he said.

Versant is also unlikely to acquire TV station groups in the current regulatory environment, Lazarus said. Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr told CNBC’s Sara Eisen Monday that national news media companies including NBC are “exercising more and more control” on local TV stations, which he said was not “a good thing for the country.”

# Selecting Versant

Comcast relied on marketing employees from each of SpinCo’s brands to help decide on a name.

Meetings began in late December, according to people familiar with the process. After a few weeks, the company had more than 1,000 potential names. Employees were told to focus on names that drew upon New York, cable TV or passing references to 30 Rockefeller Center, NBCUniversal’s headquarters, said the people.

The names were then filtered for legal and trademark infringement issues and other potential problems, such as a word’s definition in various languages. Comcast also hired three marketing agencies to help generate names and cull the list.

Lawyers passed through just 43 of the initial names, Lazarus said. That list was shortened to about a dozen finalists, which were then each presented to the deciding committee.

Lazarus and his marketing team chose Versant in the past few weeks. The word means “a region of land sloping in one general direction,” according to some references.

Lazarus joked that an uphill slope reminded him of “a rising stock price.”

Reddit,Short-term debt issued by corporations surged in April as companies sought to bolster their liquidity in the wake of economic uncertainty,">Short-term debt issued by corporations surged in April as companies sought to bolster their liquidity in the wake of economic uncertainty wrought by the Trump Administration’s tariff policies, according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

>Issuance of non-financial commercial paper swelled by $100 billion last month, which is above the monthly average of $27 billion seen from 2019 to 2024, excluding 2020, JPMorgan strategists led by Teresa Ho wrote in a note to clients on Friday, citing data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. At its peak, the gap between the highest-rated paper — known as Tier 1 — and T-bills stood at the widest level since August 2022. The spread to less credit-worthy paper — known as Tier 2 — reached its widest level since June 2023.

>“Anecdotally, it appears companies are raising cash as a precautionary measure in response to the heightened uncertainty following Liberation Day,” they wrote.

>The Trump Administration’s tariff announcement on April 2 unleashed turmoil in the financial markets, with the S&P 500 losing more than 10% in two sessions. The benchmark index reversed course a week later, when the White House delayed most of the duties for 90 days, with the exception of tariffs on China. The uncertainty also caused Treasury yields to soar and sparked a rush for cash.

Telehealth firm Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS) reported strong first-quarter 2025 results, with revenue more than doubling year-over-year to over $585 million and surpassing analyst expectations of $538.87 million. 

Net income also significantly increased, reaching $49.5 million, up from about $11 million a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 was better than a FactSet-compiled consensus of $0.12.

Despite strong results, the company's shares slid in extended trading and extended losses into early Tuesday, as its second-quarter revenue guidance of $530 million-$550 million fell short of the $564.57 million consensus estimate.

Reddit,Hollywood studio stocks fall after Trump proposes foreign film tariff,"Investors in Hollywood’s top studios and streaming services were spooked Monday after President Donald Trump proposed implementing a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery fell ahead of the opening bell, with Comcast-owned Universal also trading slightly down. Here’s how those share moves shook out:

* Netflix down more than 5%
* Disney down more than 3%
* WBD down more than 3%
* Paramount down more than 2%
* Comcast down less than 1%

Trump called tax incentives offered by foreign countries “a national security threat” in a post on Truth Social Sunday night. He said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose a levy on all films produced abroad that are sent to the United States.

How Trump intends to implement these duties is unclear, as is exactly who is being targeted and who would foot that potential tariff bill.

Hollywood studios have long filmed movies overseas, either for tax benefits or to capture the natural setting of international locations. Some films are shot in multiple countries, with many studios having satellite production hubs around the globe.

When Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, a popular filming location for Hollywood movies and television shows, industry experts told CNBC that it wouldn’t have a major impact on production. After all, the majority of projects are shot digitally, and transporting the final product can be done online or with a data storage device. There isn’t a physical good that exchanges hands in the same way as, say, toys or clothing that’s made in another country.

Questions are already swirling. What part of the production process would be hit with this duty? Would it apply only to movie projects or will TV shows filmed internationally also incur this levy? Are already completed projects exempt?

Additionally, as with the first round of tariff announcements earlier this year, industry experts worry about how these duties will impact relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup lofty film budgets. China has already closed its doors to Hollywood product. Other regions could retaliate and do the same.

Questions are already swirling. What part of the production process would be hit with this duty? Would it apply only to movie projects or will TV shows filmed internationally also incur this levy? Are already completed projects exempt?

Additionally, as with the first round of tariff announcements earlier this year, industry experts worry about how these duties will impact relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup lofty film budgets. China has already closed its doors to Hollywood product. Other regions could retaliate and do the same.

Investors in Hollywood’s top studios and streaming services were spooked Monday after President Donald Trump proposed implementing a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery fell ahead of the opening bell, with Comcast-owned Universal also trading slightly down. Here’s how those share moves shook out:

* Netflix down more than 5%
* Disney down more than 3%
* WBD down more than 3%
* Paramount down more than 2%
* Comcast down less than 1%

Trump called tax incentives offered by foreign countries “a national security threat” in a post on Truth Social Sunday night. He said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose a levy on all films produced abroad that are sent to the United States.

How Trump intends to implement these duties is unclear, as is exactly who is being targeted and who would foot that potential tariff bill.

Hollywood studios have long filmed movies overseas, either for tax benefits or to capture the natural setting of international locations. Some films are shot in multiple countries, with many studios having satellite production hubs around the globe.

McKinsey’s new report paints a massive, GPU‑hungry future for AI infrastructure. Analysts estimate global data‑center capacity will almost triple by 2030, with 70 % of the load coming from AI workloads. Meeting that demand will require nearly $7 TRILLION in capex, including $5.2 T earmarked for AI alone. Crucially, about 60 % of the total—roughly $3.1 T—will flow to “technology developers & designers,” the category that explicitly lists NVIDIA as the key supplier of the chips that power AI. In other words, three out of every five dollars poured into the coming compute build‑out lands in Jensen’s backyard.   

The report also explains why NVIDIA is poised to convert this investment tidal wave into outsized profits. GPUs remain the default engine for both training and inference, and McKinsey notes that only a handful of companies can supply them at scale—a textbook supply‑side moat. Meanwhile, hyperscalers, governments, and enterprises are locked in an arms race to deploy proprietary AI capacity, effectively guaranteeing multi‑year demand visibility and pricing power for whoever controls the silicon. Put it all together, McKinsey’s forecast isn’t just bullish for GPUs—it’s a $3‑trillion endorsement of NVIDIA’s roadmap.

Reddit,"GTA VI is my first real stock play: TTWO + SONY. in anticipation of GTAVI, here’s how I’m doing it.","So yeah this is my first time investing in the market, but I’ve been sitting on this idea since the first GTA VI trailer dropped.

I bought **100 shares of TTWO (parent company of R\*)** at $228.08. My plan is simple: sell 70 shares in April 2026, before launch, while the hype’s peaking and everyone’s scrambling to get in. Hold the other 30 through launch, just in case the sales numbers or GTA Online blow it up even more after release.

On top of that, I’m planning to throw $5K or possibly more into SONY stock around late November of this year. They’re not making the game, obviously, but PlayStation is clearly the lead platform with the trailer ends with “Captured on PS5,” and if history repeats itself, there’ll be a hardware bundle, exclusive content, maybe even a special edition console. It’s a safer, slower play  even if GTA doesn’t move SONY’s price much, the company’s diversified enough that I’m fine holding it long term.

Also  I don’t fully trust the May 2026 release date. It’s Rockstar. It’ll probably get delayed again. But to be expected and not a personal red flag just a hiccup. That’s just how they operate, and the market seems to get that. TTWO barely moved when R\* delayed the title, which tells me it wasn’t a surprise.

Just wondering if anyone else is thinking about this, particularly the TWOO + SONY combo

It seems like the market has collective amnesia about the upcoming semiconductor tariffs. How should we play this? I imagine the currently excluded product categories will be swept up under this new separate tariff regime, such as smartphones. 

Do we expect this to stack on top of other tariffs for categories that didn't receive exclusions from the retaliatory tariffs?

It seems like the market has collective amnesia about the upcoming semiconductor tariffs. How should we play this? I imagine the currently excluded product categories will be swept up under this new separate tariff regime, such as smartphones. 

Do we expect this to stack on top of other tariffs for categories that didn't receive exclusions from the retaliatory tariffs?

Things like cyclical business or recurring revenue model or low customer concentration. Ideally this data would be created in real time and stored historically and marked when changes occurred.

Reddit,(05/5) Interesting Stocks Today - Federal Student Loan Payments Continue Today,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. 

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession.

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession.

Reddit,Is PayPal Ads the solution?,"PayPal has dropped tremendously from its covid hype and has been trading very low for the last few years - even in comparison to pre-covid. Numbers are way up, buybacks are announced regularly, yet we‘re trading at pre-covid levels with not much hope.

PayPal has recently released PayPal Ads in the US and is planning to expand into UK and Germany soonish. This effort is led by Mark Grether who has a lot of experience in ads and has already proven that for Amazon and Uber.

Related releases are also happening like „Offsite Ads“ and it looks like PayPal finally woke up.

Do you think that this is a good direction for the company to invest into and will this help in turning the stock back to a growth stock?

Reddit,M. Burry was right about apple stocks," Trump’s new tariffs are hitting hard. Even if the iPhone dodged the worst, Apple’s still coughing up nearly $1B in extra costs, and shifting production to India or Vietnam isn’t a quick fix.

Then there’s the innovation problem. iPhone 16e doesn't make a lot of sense. And the foldable iPhone? Still just a rumor while Samsung folds and flips since day 1 of the  fold technology. 

And let’s not forget “Apple Intelligence”, a big move that isn't working at all like they promised, it’s underwhelming, late, and buggy. Siri still can’t hold a decent convo while others are pushing boundaries.

Adobe’s ability to generate strong returns on its invested capital is a testament to its operational efficiency and market dominance.

As of recent reports, Adobe boasts an impressive ROCE of 39%, significantly surpassing the software industry’s average benchmark.

This metric highlights Adobe’s proficiency in allocating capital to profitable ventures, particularly in its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments.

Unlike competitors, Adobe’s high ROCE reflects its ability to reinvest earnings effectively, driving sustained growth and shareholder value. 

Adobe’s financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 underscores its growth trajectory.

The company reported a record revenue of $5.71 billion, marking a 10% year-over-year increase.

This growth is primarily driven by a 12% surge in the Digital Media segment, fueled by rising subscription revenues and the integration of generative AI features, such as Firefly and AI-assisted tools in Acrobat.

These advancements have solidified Adobe’s position as a leader in creative and enterprise software solutions, enhancing its appeal to both professional and prosumer markets.

Analyst confidence in Adobe Stock remains strong, with 33 respected analysts projecting an average one-year target price of $498.86, ranging from a high of $660.00 to a low of $380.00.",2025-05-05 19:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kfqedw/adobe_stock_is_now_demonstrating_a_strong_return/,2025-05-05,"Adobe Stock Is Now Demonstrating A Strong Return on Capital.
