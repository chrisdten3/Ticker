Reddit,Trump tells Walmart to 'eat the tariffs' instead of raising prices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should ""eat the tariffs"" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.

""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post.

""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.""

A representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.

Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.

As a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.

Every week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.

Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.

Reddit,There’s no denying it now: Tariffs are raising prices,"https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/tariffs-walmart-prices-nightcap

You may be thinking, “Whatever, I went to Walmart/Target/Home Depot this week and everything was fine.” And that’s probably true, because retailers across the board stockpiled as much as they could to get ahead of Trump’s April 2 tariff rollout. But as those inventories wind down, the more-expensive goods ordered after April 2 will hit the shelves. (For Walmart, that’s expected to happen next month.)

Businesses are already absorbing the costs, according to the latest gauge of US wholesale inflation, known as the Producer Price Index. Last month, wholesale prices actually fell, which sounds like a good thing until you look a little closer at why.

The dip in the PPI came from a plunge in “trade services,” a category that measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. Essentially, that means producers are letting higher input costs eat into their profit margins while they try to figure out what to do.

Consumers are pulling back even more than economists expected. Consumer spending data for April was just barely positive year-over-year, rising 0.1%.

To be sure, there are some areas where prices are actually going down. Eggs, as the president is fond of noting, are getting cheaper. Ditto airfare, gas, sporting event tickets and hotel rooms. Unfortunately, those prices are coming down because demand is going slack. People don’t book vacations when they’re not confident about their income.

“We are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that it’s impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told my colleague Alicia Wallace.

Bottom line: We’re in it now, folks.

Reddit,Tesla limits investors' ability to sue over breach of fiduciary duties,"In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company’s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.

The filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted “an ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla’s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.”

Tesla’s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.

According to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. 

“Obviously, for a company of Tesla’s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,” she said in an email.

By comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.

Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla’s board, had controlled the company and that the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working “alongside him, almost as an advisory body,” the judge ruled.

The Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders’ approval to do so after that loss in court.

Tesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware’s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.

Reddit,[HLT stock] Most of net worth in employee stock purchase program. Continue the course or diversify?,"
I have been putting 15% of my paycheck into the ESPP (employee stock purchase program), and have amassed almost 60k. The stock has been performing magnificently and I’m up 82% since I’ve started contributing in 2020. We can purchase the stock at a 15% discount based on the closing price at the beginning or end of the “purchase period,” which is six months.

HLT seems to be insulated fairly well as it operates on a franchise and service-based business model. Of course we’re affected by tarriffs and the current economic environment, but I’m still extremely bullish on the stock.

Should I continue to maximize my contribution and have that be my *main* receptacle of savings? I feel like it’s just *too good* of a deal right now. I do want to maximize my Roth but this just seems to be such a greater opportunity of return.

35/m. Making ~95-100k. Rent is 1785/month. No material debt.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-Shares of UNH fell nearly 13% following reports of a DOJ criminal investigation into potential Medicare fraud. The company stated it was unaware of any such probe. Loved this stock trading wise yesterday- premarket we had a ""rebuttal"" of UNH saying they weren't aware of any DOJ investigation, so we saw the stock spike up 10 points and then fall back, sell off, then hit \~$250 at the low. I think UNH is ridiculously cheap at this price, and even with a DOJ investigation I believe that losing close to $50B in market cap is unjustified. 

Managed to snipe the low, currently long and thinking of merging into long-term holdings. Even with triple the damages (standard in this case), damages are \~$5B from my research. I believe UNH is essentially ""too big to fail"" in the healthcare sector as well, and possible exclusion from Medicare is essentially shooting ACA in the face at this point and screwing over millions of people. Other than that, I have a low enough price to not be too concerned.

[**CHTR (Charter)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CHTR&p=d)\-CHTR announced a $34.5B merger with Cox Communications, combining their broadband and mobile services to compete with streaming/wireless. Interestingly enough, it's essentially flat but that's because it's illiquid premarket. Right now, post-merger means that CHTR is essentially the largest cable operator in the US. The biggest obstacle here is deal risk from regulators. In the words of Logan Roy, ""Money wins"". 

[**TVTX (Travere)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TVTX&p=d)\-TVTX's shares declined after the FDA did not grant priority review for its sNDA for FILSPARI (sparsentan) in treating FSGS, potentially delaying its market entry. Sparsentan is meant to slow kidney function decline in adults with primary IgA nephropathy, moved the stock significantly (-20%) yesterday. In the biotech sector, timely FDA reviews are critical for small-cap companies. Delays can significantly screw their revenue and drug pipelines (and investor confidence). Interested to see it closer to $15. 

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-NVO announced CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down amid declining share prices and increased competition in the obesity drug market. We saw a selloff from 67.50 ->62, but frankly NVO is in a tough spot. Wegovy is essentially ""last gen"" at this point and we have better alternatives. Their new drug CagriSema hasn't had great trial results, so they're frankly still behind. LLY's Zepbound still outperforms. I wouldn't be too surprised if this recovered, (it partially has premarket) but far more interested in UNH today.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-Shares of UNH fell nearly 13% following reports of a DOJ criminal investigation into potential Medicare fraud. The company stated it was unaware of any such probe. Loved this stock trading wise yesterday- premarket we had a ""rebuttal"" of UNH saying they weren't aware of any DOJ investigation, so we saw the stock spike up 10 points and then fall back, sell off, then hit \~$250 at the low. I think UNH is ridiculously cheap at this price, and even with a DOJ investigation I believe that losing close to $50B in market cap is unjustified. 

Managed to snipe the low, currently long and thinking of merging into long-term holdings. Even with triple the damages (standard in this case), damages are \~$5B from my research. I believe UNH is essentially ""too big to fail"" in the healthcare sector as well, and possible exclusion from Medicare is essentially shooting ACA in the face at this point and screwing over millions of people. Other than that, I have a low enough price to not be too concerned.

[**CHTR (Charter)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CHTR&p=d)\-CHTR announced a $34.5B merger with Cox Communications, combining their broadband and mobile services to compete with streaming/wireless. Interestingly enough, it's essentially flat but that's because it's illiquid premarket. Right now, post-merger means that CHTR is essentially the largest cable operator in the US. The biggest obstacle here is deal risk from regulators. In the words of Logan Roy, ""Money wins"". 

[**TVTX (Travere)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TVTX&p=d)\-TVTX's shares declined after the FDA did not grant priority review for its sNDA for FILSPARI (sparsentan) in treating FSGS, potentially delaying its market entry. Sparsentan is meant to slow kidney function decline in adults with primary IgA nephropathy, moved the stock significantly (-20%) yesterday. In the biotech sector, timely FDA reviews are critical for small-cap companies. Delays can significantly screw their revenue and drug pipelines (and investor confidence). Interested to see it closer to $15. 

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-NVO announced CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down amid declining share prices and increased competition in the obesity drug market. We saw a selloff from 67.50 ->62, but frankly NVO is in a tough spot. Wegovy is essentially ""last gen"" at this point and we have better alternatives. Their new drug CagriSema hasn't had great trial results, so they're frankly still behind. LLY's Zepbound still outperforms. I wouldn't be too surprised if this recovered, (it partially has premarket) but far more interested in UNH today.

Reddit,Can someone critique my stock strategy,"I’m only 22 and I’ve started in the stock market in November 2023. I put 4000 in and so far I’ve beaten the s&p by 4% last year and so far in 2025 beating it by 4% again for a total of 5900 right now. I’m pretty new and I’ve never had any advice besides put your money in an index fund and forget but my separate 401k is already like that so I wanted to have something I can manage more directly.  I just want some guidance as my objective is slow growth but slightly beating the s&p 500 each year. 

My strategy is I have 25 stocks that I think are good long term holds as I kind of want to create my own index fund with stocks I like. Then I have 5 index funds I currently own which are VTI VB VFC VGT and QQQ which I do not plan on selling but my positions are individually worth the same as the stocks in my portfolio. 

The way I buy stocks is I cannot buy less than the minimum share I currently own. For example if I currently own 1.1 share of a random stock in my portfolio, that is my baseline and I have to buy more than that share for any stock I choose to buy. However I try not to go way above that minimum amount I set for myself. Overall this is to help me slowly build my positions without overdoing and not throw all of my money into one stock. 

I can only trade once a month. One sell and one buy as this is not to overthink my positions but at the same time giving myself a chance to adapt to market situations each month. 




Overall this strategy has beaten the s&p 500 comfortably last year and this year but I would like to see what you guys think cause I’m no genius and in fact I’m quite the opposite and probably can be doing something much better. 

I would also like to slowly deposit more money into my portfolio but I’m currently broke and all of my money is going into rent and living expenses so the money I saved up in college is the money that I have to work with right now",2025-05-16 16:54:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1koblbu/can_someone_critique_my_stock_strategy/,2025-05-16 16:54:44,"Can someone critique my stock strategy.

Then I have 5 index funds I currently own which are VTI VB VFC VGT and QQQ which I do not plan on selling but my positions are individually worth the same as the stocks in my portfolio. 

The way I buy stocks is I cannot buy less than the minimum share I currently own. For example if I currently own 1.1 share of a random stock in my portfolio, that is my baseline and I have to buy more than that share for any stock I choose to buy. However I try not to go way above that minimum amount I set for myself. Overall this is to help me slowly build my positions without overdoing and not throw all of my money into one stock. 

I can only trade once a month. One sell and one buy as this is not to overthink my positions but at the same time giving myself a chance to adapt to market situations each month. 




Overall this strategy has beaten the s&p 500 comfortably last year and this year but I would like to see what you guys think cause I’m no genius and in fact I’m quite the opposite and probably can be doing something much better.

Reddit,Stock Review: Insulet: PODD,"Insulet is the maker of diabetic Omnipod. The omnipod is a cordless insulin injection machine. Basically the users place it on their body and every 5 minutes it works to take a blood sample and adjust insulin as needed.

What is great about this company is these pods are good for 72 hours and are replaced after that window. This makes for a recurring revenue stream on a diversified customer base. While there are new products to fight weight loss, obesity and age have been in bull markets and I expect this will continue.

In 2 years, sales are expected to be $3.8 and price to sales has ranged between 6 to 17x with an average of 10 to 14x. This implies a market cap of $38 to $53 vs a current value of $23b. Shares have diluted the company by 3-4% per year over the last few years and no dividend.

Back of the napkin gets you over 20% per year. How? (((45.5 mid point market cap) / 23b -1)/3 years)-4% dilution.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Reddit,Puma & Cristiano Ronaldo World Cup 2026,"Puma SE (PMMAF)

Puma just released Q1 2025 earnings: slightly ahead of expectations, and signs of strong acceleration:

Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) sales up 12%, E-commerce +17% YoY

Clear winner of the “Buy European” movement

Cristiano Ronaldo + World Cup 2026 = massive global visibility

But here’s the real kicker: the valuation.

Compared to global peers like Nike and Adidas, Puma looks severely undervalued:

P/E (TTM): ~13.5 vs. Nike (~28) and Adidas (~24)

P/S ratio: ~0.9 vs. Nike (~3.7), Adidas (~1.8)

EV/EBITDA: ~8.5 – very low for a global brand with growth tailwinds

Why it matters:
Investors are sleeping on Puma. It’s not a turnaround story – it’s an execution story in a market full of overpriced names. Brand is strong, margins are improving, and the World Cup (with CR7 in Puma boots!) is a marketing jackpot waiting to happen.

This could be a high-upside, low-expectation growth play in 2025–2026.

Reddit,Coinbase says hackers bribed staff to steal customer data and are demanding $20 million ransom,"> Coinbase on Thursday reported that cyber criminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data to use in social engineering attacks. The incident may cost Coinbase up to $400 million to fix, the company estimated. The crypto exchange operator received an email on May 11 from someone claiming they obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts as well as other internal Coinbase documentation, including materials relating to customer-service and account-management systems, Coinbase reported in an SEC filing. Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, affected data included sensitive data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and emails; masked bank account numbers and identifiers as well as the last four digits of social security numbers; government ID images and account balances, the company said.

> “Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks,” the company said in a blog post. “These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker.” Coinbase had detected the breach independently in previous months, per the filing. It immediately terminated the employees involved, warned customers whose information may have been accessed and enhanced its fraud monitoring protections.

> The threat actor paid overseas contractors and employees in support rolls to obtain the information, it said. “We’re cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received,” the company said in the blog. “Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.” Coinbase operates the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. In that past week it announced an acquisition that is expected to help it expand its global reach and gained entry to the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which will take effect next week.

Reddit,Charter Communications and Cox Communications Announce Definitive Agreement to Combine Companies,"# Key Takeaways

* Charter and Cox will create an industry leader in mobile, broadband communications and seamless video entertainment with high-quality customer service.
* The combination will benefit customers, employees, communities and shareholders.
* Proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.

**Stamford, CT and Atlanta, GA** – Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, “Charter”) and Cox Communications (“Cox”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their businesses in a transformative transaction that will create an industry leader in mobile and broadband communications services, seamless video entertainment, and high-quality customer service delivering powerful benefits for American employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. The proposed transaction values Cox Communications at an enterprise value of approximately $34.5 billion^(1) based on, and at parity with, Charter’s recent enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple.

“We’re honored that the Cox family has entrusted us with its impressive legacy and are excited by the opportunity to benefit from the terrific operating history and community leadership of Cox,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. “Cox and Charter have been innovators in connectivity and entertainment services – with decades of work and hundreds of billions of dollars invested to build, upgrade, and expand our complementary regional networks to provide high-quality internet, video, voice and mobile services. This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses. We will continue to deliver high-value products that save American families money, and we’ll onshore jobs from overseas to create new, good-paying careers for U.S. employees that come with great benefits, career training and advancement, and retirement and ownership opportunities.” 

The Cox family is the longest continuous operator in the industry, having acquired its first cable television franchise in 1962. “Our family has always believed that investing for the long-term and staying committed to the best interests of our customers, employees and communities is the best recipe for success,” said Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises. “In Charter, we’ve found the right partner at the right time and in the right position to take this commitment to a higher level than ever before, delivering an incredible outcome for our customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities we serve.”

“Charter’s board and I are excited about this transaction and very supportive of Alex stepping into the board Chairman role,” said Eric Zinterhofer, Chairman of Charter’s Board of Directors. “The combination of Cox Communications with Charter is an excellent outcome for our collective shareholders, customers, employees and the industry.”

# Structure and Timing 

In the transaction, Charter will acquire Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses, and Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter. Cox’s assets have been valued using Cox’s 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by Charter’s total enterprise value to 2025 estimated Adjusted EBITDA trading multiple of 6.44x, based on: 

* Wall Street consensus for Charter’s 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, and
* Charter’s (NASDAQ: CHTR) 60-day Volume Weighted Average Price of $353.64, as of 4/25/25.

As consideration in the transaction, Cox Enterprises will receive:

*  $4 billion in cash,
* $6 billion notional amount of convertible preferred units in Charter’s existing partnership, which pay a 6.875% coupon, and which are convertible into Charter partnership units, which are then exchangeable for Charter common shares, and
* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. 

Based on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. 

Within a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. 

# Governance 

Following the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. 

It is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. 

Upon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. 

# Community Leadership 

The Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges. 

# Strategic and Customer Objectives 

Following the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans. 

The new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments. Charter customers will benefit from Cox Business’ well-known industry leadership in business telecommunications, including Segra and RapidScale. 

Charter and Cox employees will benefit from investments in employee-focused technology and AI tools and an expansion of Charter’s self-progression career advancement model for promotions and standardized pay increases. 

# Specific Benefits From the Combination Include: 

* The combined company will bring together the best products and practices of each company to benefit all of the combined company’s customers and employees.
* The combined company will be better positioned to aggressively compete in an expanding and dynamic marketplace that includes:
   * Larger, national broadband companies with wireline and wireless capabilities,
   * Regional wireline and mobile competitors,
   * Global video distribution providers and platforms, and satellite broadband companies.
* The combined company also will be better positioned for continued and expanded investment and innovation:
   * In mobile, given the increased footprint;
   * In video, where Big Tech currently leverages global scale in content and distribution;
   * In advertising, where the transaction will expand opportunities for advertisers large and small, national, regional, and local, bringing new competition in an area now dominated by Big Tech;
   * In the business sector, where the combined company will have additional coverage, yet still remain a regional player competing against larger, national competitors;
   * And through greater product innovation in areas including AI tools and small cell deployment of licensed, shared licensed and unlicensed spectrum, bringing new and advanced services and capabilities to consumers and businesses.
* Cox customers will gain access to Charter’s simple and transparent pricing and packaging structure, including no annual contracts for any residential services, which means customers are free to change service providers at any time, with no risk of early termination fees.
* Cox customers also will benefit from Charter’s industry-first Customer Service Commitments, which include:
   * Charter’s 100% U.S.-based customer service team available 24/7.
   * Charter has committed to fixing service disruptions quickly, including same-day technician dispatch when requested before 5:00 pm; if not, the next day.
   * Charter provides customers credits for outages that last longer than two hours.
* This proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.
   * The combined company will adopt Charter’s sales and service workforce model, which will fully return Cox’s customer service function to the U.S.
   * ­All employees will earn a starting wage of *at least* $20 per hour and will gain access to Charter’s industry-leading benefits, which include:
      * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees; Charter has absorbed the full premium cost increase for the last 12 years.
      * Market-leading retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with a company match up to 6% of their eligible pay, with an additional 3% contribution available for most employees.
      * Free or discounted Spectrum Mobile, TV and Internet service.
      * Multiple opportunities for upward advancement and to build careers, including through tuition-free undergraduate degree and certificate programs via flexible online learning; self-progression programs with standardized pay raises, and formal development programs, such as the Broadband Field Technician Apprenticeship program.
      * Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides frontline employees the ability to purchase stock and receive a matching grant of Charter Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) up to 1 for 1 based on years of service, offering employees another meaningful incentive to grow their careers with Charter.
* The combined company will expand Charter’s award-winning local Spectrum News stations in the Cox footprint, bringing hyper-local, unbiased news coverage to more communities. The combined company will not own any national programming,
* The combined company will retain its industry leadership in protecting the security of U.S. communications networks from foreign threats. 

# Financial Outlook 

By deploying Charter’s operating strategy across Cox’s footprint, the combined company will: 

* Offer Cox customers the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans,
* Invest in more U.S.-based employees,
* Continually improve service quality,
* And support the development of third-party platforms for new consumer products through continuing network evolution. 

Despite those investments, the combined business is expected to produce higher cash flow per passing and investment returns over time by creating and preserving more relationships on a fixed network, selling more products to each customer, and reducing operating and capital costs per passing by lowering service transactions, churn and fixed cost leverage.  

Charter also currently expects approximately $500 million of annualized cost synergies achieved within three years of close – stemming from typical procurement and overhead savings.

* Approximately 33.6 million common units in Charter’s existing partnership, with an implied value of $11.9 billion^(2), and which are exchangeable for Charter common shares. 

Based on Charter’s share count as of March 31, 2025, at the closing, Cox Enterprises will own approximately 23% of the combined entity’s fully diluted shares outstanding, on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, and pro forma for the closing of the Liberty Broadband merger. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory and Charter shareholder approvals. The combined entity will assume Cox’s approximately $12 billion in outstanding debt. 

Within a year after the closing, the combined company will change its name to Cox Communications. Spectrum will become the consumer-facing brand within the communities Cox serves. The combined company will remain headquartered in Stamford, CT, and will maintain a significant presence on Cox’s Atlanta, GA campus following the closing. 

# Governance 

Following the closing, Mr. Winfrey will continue in his current role as President & CEO, and board member. Mr. Taylor will join the board as Chairman, and Mr. Zinterhofer will become the lead independent director on Charter’s board. Cox will have the right to nominate an additional two board members to Charter’s 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, another storied cable innovator, which contributed its operations to Charter’s partnership in 2016, will retain its two board nominees. 

It is expected that Charter’s combination with Cox will be completed contemporaneously with the previously announced Liberty Broadband merger. As a result, Liberty Broadband will cease to be a direct shareholder in Charter and will no longer designate directors for election to the Charter Board. Accordingly, the three current Liberty Broadband nominees on Charter’s board will resign at closing. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interests in Charter as a result of the Liberty Broadband merger. 

Upon closing, Charter, Cox Enterprises and Advance/Newhouse will enter into an amended and restated stockholders agreement, which will provide for preemptive rights over certain issuances, voting caps and required participation in Charter common share repurchases at specified acquisition caps, and transfer restrictions among other shareholder governance matters. 

# Community Leadership 

The Cox family of businesses was founded 127 years ago on the promise of “building a better future for the next generation.” Both Cox and Charter want to see that intent reinforced in this new partnership. The Cox family’s commitment to supporting its communities through the philanthropic work of the James M. Cox Foundation will be continued by Charter’s $50 million grant to establish a separate foundation that will encourage community leadership and support where the combined company does business. Additionally, Charter will make an initial $5 million investment to establish an employee relief fund that mirrors the Cox Employee Relief Fund, which Cox and the Cox family created in 2005 to help employees through times of hardships such as natural disasters or other unexpected life challenges. 

# Strategic and Customer Objectives 

Following the closing, the combined company’s industry-leading products will launch across Cox’s approximately 12 million passings and 6 million existing customers, under the Spectrum brand – including Spectrum’s Advanced WiFi, Spectrum Mobile with Mobile Speed Boost, the Spectrum TV App, Seamless Entertainment and Xumo – and which, when coupled with Spectrum’s transparent and customer-focused pricing and packaging structure, will provide Cox customers with enhanced flexibility and convenience, as well as the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans. 

The new combination will create a best-in-class customer service model. That model will integrate Cox’s rich service history with Charter’s 100% U.S.-based, employee-focused service and sales model and industry-leading customer commitments. Charter customers will benefit from Cox Business’ well-known industry leadership in business telecommunications, including Segra and RapidScale. 

Charter and Cox employees will benefit from investments in employee-focused technology and AI tools and an expansion of Charter’s self-progression career advancement model for promotions and standardized pay increases. 

# Specific Benefits From the Combination Include: 

* The combined company will bring together the best products and practices of each company to benefit all of the combined company’s customers and employees.
* The combined company will be better positioned to aggressively compete in an expanding and dynamic marketplace that includes:
   * Larger, national broadband companies with wireline and wireless capabilities,
   * Regional wireline and mobile competitors,
   * Global video distribution providers and platforms, and satellite broadband companies.
* The combined company also will be better positioned for continued and expanded investment and innovation:
   * In mobile, given the increased footprint;
   * In video, where Big Tech currently leverages global scale in content and distribution;
   * In advertising, where the transaction will expand opportunities for advertisers large and small, national, regional, and local, bringing new competition in an area now dominated by Big Tech;
   * In the business sector, where the combined company will have additional coverage, yet still remain a regional player competing against larger, national competitors;
   * And through greater product innovation in areas including AI tools and small cell deployment of licensed, shared licensed and unlicensed spectrum, bringing new and advanced services and capabilities to consumers and businesses.
* Cox customers will gain access to Charter’s simple and transparent pricing and packaging structure, including no annual contracts for any residential services, which means customers are free to change service providers at any time, with no risk of early termination fees.
* Cox customers also will benefit from Charter’s industry-first Customer Service Commitments, which include:
   * Charter’s 100% U.S.-based customer service team available 24/7.
   * Charter has committed to fixing service disruptions quickly, including same-day technician dispatch when requested before 5:00 pm; if not, the next day.
   * Charter provides customers credits for outages that last longer than two hours.
* This proposed transaction puts America first by returning jobs from overseas and creating new, good-paying customer service and sales careers.
   * The combined company will adopt Charter’s sales and service workforce model, which will fully return Cox’s customer service function to the U.S.
   * ­All employees will earn a starting wage of *at least* $20 per hour and will gain access to Charter’s industry-leading benefits, which include:
      * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees; Charter has absorbed the full premium cost increase for the last 12 years.
      * Market-leading retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with a company match up to 6% of their eligible pay, with an additional 3% contribution available for most employees.
      * Free or discounted Spectrum Mobile, TV and Internet service.
      * Multiple opportunities for upward advancement and to build careers, including through tuition-free undergraduate degree and certificate programs via flexible online learning; self-progression programs with standardized pay raises, and formal development programs, such as the Broadband Field Technician Apprenticeship program.
      * Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides frontline employees the ability to purchase stock and receive a matching grant of Charter Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) up to 1 for 1 based on years of service, offering employees another meaningful incentive to grow their careers with Charter.
* The combined company will expand Charter’s award-winning local Spectrum News stations in the Cox footprint, bringing hyper-local, unbiased news coverage to more communities. The combined company will not own any national programming,
* The combined company will retain its industry leadership in protecting the security of U.S. communications networks from foreign threats. 

# Financial Outlook 

By deploying Charter’s operating strategy across Cox’s footprint, the combined company will: 

* Offer Cox customers the choice to pay less for new Spectrum bundled services or to keep their current plans,
* Invest in more U.S.-based employees,
* Continually improve service quality,
* And support the development of third-party platforms for new consumer products through continuing network evolution. 

Despite those investments, the combined business is expected to produce higher cash flow per passing and investment returns over time by creating and preserving more relationships on a fixed network, selling more products to each customer, and reducing operating and capital costs per passing by lowering service transactions, churn and fixed cost leverage.  

Charter also currently expects approximately $500 million of annualized cost synergies achieved within three years of close – stemming from typical procurement and overhead savings.

Reddit,"Walmart CFO says price hikes from tariffs could start later this month, as retailer beats on earnings","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html


> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. 

> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected

- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected

> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.

> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.

> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less.

Reddit,Why Tesla is another Enron - How can a company with a valuation equal to the world's seven largest automakers Earnings Catch-up,"So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla's current valuation is equal to the sum of the world's seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face ""Earnings Catch-up"", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla's sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla's main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?

In my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.

My teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called ""Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room"".

Therefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past. Beliefs and slogans are like the horn of the technological paradise, gathering a large number of irrational investors.


From the perspective of pure finance and financial market technical theory, the financial pressure that Tesla needs to fulfill in 2026 is so great that it is suffocating, or even desperate. There have been many investors who scolded me while listening to my analysis. This is because they do not understand technology and only know how to buy and sell. In the past few years, they only read the parts of investment research reports that they like to read. They regard the risk part as a joke.

This involves a core issue. Musk said ""he doesn't care about making cars anymore"", which is good, and it can get rid of the problem of ""car manufacturer pricing"". But it faces the second problem of ""how to price Tesla"". Robotaxi? From an objective technical point of view, it is unknown when Tesla's Robotaxi will catch up with Waymo. After all, Waymo completed L4 autonomous driving as early as 2019, while FSD is still L2 to this day. Many people don't know that it is actually L2, not even L3.

Bipedal robots? From the perspective of the academic community in Australia and Europe, that is a joke. Not to mention Japan, a robot powerhouse, where even FANUC is not so optimistic.

More carbon credits? Yes, but the scale of growth will be limited unless the White House gives more taxpayer money.



Speculating on Bitcoin, using data centers to mine Bitcoin? It's not impossible, after all, are they scammers?


Humankind has not made any breakthroughs in basic science since the 1980s. Europe has been working hard to make breakthroughs in basic science, so they spent a huge amount of time to build colliders, while the United States has invested billions of dollars in mining and AI. This is the problem the United States faces today.

This article would be worth $50,000 if I were giving a talk, so I won’t go into too much detail, just to add to the urge to pee when I wake up late at night in Australia.

Reddit,Dick’s Sporting Goods to buy Foot Locker for $2.4 billion,"Dick’s Sporting Goods has agreed to buy smaller rival Foot Lockerfor $2.4 billion, the second major footwear deal this month after the buyout of Skechers, as U.S. retailers look to navigate a tough demand landscape.

The sporting goods retailer has offered $24 per share of Foot Locker, the companies said on Thursday, representing an 86% premium to the stock’s last close.

Shares of Foot Locker surged 82% to $23.45 in premarket trading, after losing about 40% in the year so far. Dick’s Sporting Goods fell 8%.

The acquisition, Dick’s largest deal in the sporting goods industry, will help the company boost its presence in malls and expand to international markets for the first time, positioning the retailer to better tackle a slowdown in consumer spending.

Several U.S. retailers have issued gloomy forecasts in recent weeks as the Trump administration’s hefty tariffs have forced Americans to tighten spending in anticipation of potentially higher prices on everything from household staples to toys and apparel.

Over the last few years, Foot Locker has lost market share to competition from brands such as Nike and Under Armour, which have expanded their direct-to-consumer business, as well as falling customer visits to indoor malls, where most Foot Locker stores are located.

It operates 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in markets including North America, Europe and Asia, and logged worldwide sales of $8 billion last year.

Shares of Foot Locker surged 82% to $23.45 in premarket trading, after losing about 40% in the year so far. Dick’s Sporting Goods fell 8%.

The acquisition, Dick’s largest deal in the sporting goods industry, will help the company boost its presence in malls and expand to international markets for the first time, positioning the retailer to better tackle a slowdown in consumer spending.

Several U.S. retailers have issued gloomy forecasts in recent weeks as the Trump administration’s hefty tariffs have forced Americans to tighten spending in anticipation of potentially higher prices on everything from household staples to toys and apparel.

Over the last few years, Foot Locker has lost market share to competition from brands such as Nike and Under Armour, which have expanded their direct-to-consumer business, as well as falling customer visits to indoor malls, where most Foot Locker stores are located.

It operates 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in markets including North America, Europe and Asia, and logged worldwide sales of $8 billion last year.

Reddit,Boeing's record-breaking deal: Qatar Airways to buy up to 210 planes,"Boeing and Qatar Airways on Wednesday announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker’s largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.

Qatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.

Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”

Reddit,Who wins the robotaxi race - WAYMO or Tesla?,"BIG QUESTION ready for discussion - as there is so much momentum behind TESLA and Musk' statements around the Robotaxi and FSD.

Waymo seems to be far ahead of Tesla and has 1.500 cars on the streets in 4 big US cities, while Musk talks about 10-20 cars to be placed in June/July in Austin.

Waymo now reached 250k rides per week, a steep incline from 150k in Oct 2024 and 50k in May 2024.

“In fact, these vehicles can pick up their first public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory,” Waymo said in its blog post. The company said that vehicles intended for other cities can be deployed into public service in a matter of hours after being shipped to their local depot.

Besides, questions remains on ""camera only""-concept of Tesla competing with camera/LIDAR/radar of others. Others deem camera only concept to be unsafe in conditions like rain and fog. Telsa is rumoured to have hit a dead end road with this concept.

John Krafcik, former Waymo CEO, clapped back, telling Business Insider, ""Tesla has never competed with Waymo — they've never sold a robotaxi ride to a public rider, but they've sold a lot of cars."" His email continued, ""And although Tesla hopes to compete with Waymo someday, they've failed utterly and completely at this for each of the 10 years they've been talking about it.""

Reddit,UnitedHealth Stock (UNH) Continues to Suffer from Donald Trump's Executive Order Do You Think It Will Rise Next?,"UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments. Rising medical costs, an unexpected CEO departure, and heightened regulatory uncertainty stemming from former President Trump’s recent executive order on drug pricing have all contributed to investor unease.





While the stock may appear attractively valued following its sharp decline, caution is warranted. The current environment remains highly uncertain, and further downside risks could materialize in the near term. As a result, I am bearish on UNH.



Rising Medical Costs Rattle Nerves

UNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.





In fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization. Since then, investors have naturally kept dumping shares as faith in UNH’s cost management faltered.



CEO Exit Sparks Leadership Crisis

As the dust was settling, UNH dropped a bombshell: CEO Andrew Witty resigned abruptly two days ago for “personal reasons,” and the company withdrew its prior full-year outlook. Stephen Hemsley, a former CEO and current chairman, stepped back into the top role, but the move feels like an unplanned stopgap.



Witty’s departure caps a rough year for the company, one that saw a massive cyberattack exposing the data of 190 million customers and the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Notably, the fact that his resignation came right after UNH missed earnings for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis has raised questions about what else might be going wrong behind the scenes. At 72 years of age, analysts see Hemsley as a temporary fix. So that has, reasonably so, only added to investor anxiety over the company’s lack of a long-term plan.



The craziest part is that UNH’s leadership void couldn’t come at a worse time. UNH faces scrutiny over soaring medical costs and public outrage tied to Thompson’s killing, which sparked debates about insurer practices. Witty had driven UNH’s revenue to $400 billion, but recent stumbles eroded confidence. With Hemsley steering a ship under regulatory and operational strain, the absence of a long-term leader risks keeping UNH’s stock in the penalty box.



Trump’s Drug Pricing Order Targets PBMs

However, the most decisive blow landed on Monday this week, when President Trump signed an executive order to slash U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower costs abroad. This wasn’t just a hit to drugmakers as it directly aimed at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like UNH’s Optum Rx, accusing them of inflating costs.





Reuters reported that the order seeks to skip PBMs, potentially disrupting their role in negotiating drug prices. Clearly, the broader threat to Optum Rx’s margins looms large, especially as analysts warn of legal and regulatory hurdles that could prolong uncertainty.



A Bargain with Baggage

On paper, one could argue that UNH looks like a steal. Trading at roughly 13x this year’s consensus EPS, it’s a far cry from its historical premium, while the 55% share price plunge, which has primarily taken place in just a month, suggests the market may have overreacted.



The bottom line is that UNH isn’t a small-cap with a speculative business model but an insurance behemoth that generates revenues over $400 billion per annum. It has a fantastic track record of generating high returns on capital and returning cash to shareholders.

UNH’s most significant challenge these days is the underlying surge in medical costs that have blindsided management. As the most prominent provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., serving over 8 million seniors, UNH has faced a flurry of claims as patients seek delayed procedures like hip and knee replacements post-COVID. That was one of the biggest reasons UNH slashed its full-year outlook last month after a rare earnings miss.





In fact, that was UNH’s first earnings miss since 2008. The company cited “unanticipated changes” in its Optum unit and higher-than-expected care utilization. Since then, investors have naturally kept dumping shares as faith in UNH’s cost management faltered.



CEO Exit Sparks Leadership Crisis

As the dust was settling, UNH dropped a bombshell: CEO Andrew Witty resigned abruptly two days ago for “personal reasons,” and the company withdrew its prior full-year outlook. Stephen Hemsley, a former CEO and current chairman, stepped back into the top role, but the move feels like an unplanned stopgap.



Witty’s departure caps a rough year for the company, one that saw a massive cyberattack exposing the data of 190 million customers and the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Notably, the fact that his resignation came right after UNH missed earnings for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis has raised questions about what else might be going wrong behind the scenes. At 72 years of age, analysts see Hemsley as a temporary fix. So that has, reasonably so, only added to investor anxiety over the company’s lack of a long-term plan.



The craziest part is that UNH’s leadership void couldn’t come at a worse time. UNH faces scrutiny over soaring medical costs and public outrage tied to Thompson’s killing, which sparked debates about insurer practices. Witty had driven UNH’s revenue to $400 billion, but recent stumbles eroded confidence. With Hemsley steering a ship under regulatory and operational strain, the absence of a long-term leader risks keeping UNH’s stock in the penalty box.



Trump’s Drug Pricing Order Targets PBMs

However, the most decisive blow landed on Monday this week, when President Trump signed an executive order to slash U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower costs abroad. This wasn’t just a hit to drugmakers as it directly aimed at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like UNH’s Optum Rx, accusing them of inflating costs.





Reuters reported that the order seeks to skip PBMs, potentially disrupting their role in negotiating drug prices. Clearly, the broader threat to Optum Rx’s margins looms large, especially as analysts warn of legal and regulatory hurdles that could prolong uncertainty.



A Bargain with Baggage

On paper, one could argue that UNH looks like a steal. Trading at roughly 13x this year’s consensus EPS, it’s a far cry from its historical premium, while the 55% share price plunge, which has primarily taken place in just a month, suggests the market may have overreacted.



The bottom line is that UNH isn’t a small-cap with a speculative business model but an insurance behemoth that generates revenues over $400 billion per annum. It has a fantastic track record of generating high returns on capital and returning cash to shareholders.

UnitedHealth (UNH) has experienced significant volatility, with its stock down approximately 55% from its 52-week high. Once viewed as a stable blue-chip stalwart, the company trades more like a distressed asset amid a series of negative developments.

The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into ""questionable diagnoses"" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news.

I don't want to discuss this topic with people who have no science and engineering background anymore. Really, there is a saying in China that ""if you don't cheat a fool's money, it's a waste."" These people are the same.

Sometimes I really feel strange about the US stock market. The SEC is like a thing that bullies the weak and clings to the powerful. On the contrary, even the China Banking Regulatory Commission, which is called the ""fraud market"", has always been a heavy-handed strike in regulating companies. It's just that it must cooperate with the Chinese government to control stock prices and the stock market, but it has never been afraid of any company. And the SEC is too weak.",TM
Reddit,"Regarding the UNH criminal probe, look at the WellCare fraud for clues of the Armageddon scenario.","Back in 2007, criminal charges were bought against WellCare and its executives for defrauding Florida's Medicaid program.

In October 23, 2007, the Justice Department announced charges against the company and the stock dropped from $115 to $20 over a few days, a loss of 82%.

However, it recovered back to its previous price levels by 2017 and reached $350 in 2021 before being acquired. 

So... if the worst happens to UNH (e.g., criminal probe where charges are filed and the government brings the hammer against the company and wins), expect this to go way below $200 and stay there for a long time.

Reddit,Purely rational: Tesla robotaxi without L4 isn’t even a Challenger — Magic Quadrant shows how far it is from Waymo’s leadership,"

||

|**Leaders**|WAYMO|
|**Challengers**|Cruise|
|**Visionaries**|Zoox,AutoX|
|**Niche Players**|Tesla Robotaxi，Pony.ai|



In our business analysis, there is a method called Gartner Magic Quadrants. If a normal analyst puts Tesla's CyberCAB product in this analysis method, he will only have one position, that is, NichePlayers, and even this is overestimating Tesla. After all, Waymo officially has L4 level autonomous driving, while Tesla's FSD is only L2 (in case you haven't heard, Tesla's FSD is only L2, not even L3).



Waymo is obviously in the leader quadrant. It has launched fully autonomous Robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. It has been successfully running for six years since 2019, although there have been many funny accidents during this period. But Waymo at least dares to claim that it has L4, not L3, or L3 plus, or like FSD, which is obviously L2 but induces the driver to let go. (By the way, L2 allows the driver to take both hands off the steering wheel, and only the United States can do this in the world).

So Tesla doesn't even have L4 autonomous driving, so what can it use to compete with Waymo, which dares to apply for L4 and uses lidar technology that is ridiculed by Tesla fans. L2 means that the responsibility is put on the driver, but L4 requires Waymo to pay for every accident with real money.

As of 15/May/2025 (sorry, we are used to typing dates like this in Australia). Tesla has not submitted an application for L4 autonomous driving, so I would like to ask Tesla fans. What will they use to make Cybercab on June 19? Of course, Musk's good friend, a gentleman in the White House, may be able to slam the table and roar angrily, demanding that NHTSA officials unconditionally let his best political allies and election campaigners start Robotaxi business immediately.



From my perspective, the US stock market really feels like the Nasdaq bubble in 2000. It is full of lies and incompetence at the regulatory level. The entire market is either VR, AR or AI, quantum chips (here again, quantum algorithms do not solve the problem of general computing. Before 2022, there were many research projects in the United States to study how to accelerate quantum computing for general computing, and they all failed), autonomous driving, and cryptocurrency. Remove MAG7, where is the value of the United States?

In my opinion, Europe is better than the United States. The European academic community does not brag about AI, but focuses on researching colliders.

I once asked a friend from NASA, ""Why don't you launch more deep space satellites to explore the universe?"" Their answer was ""Space science is not like Silicon Valley, where you can just blow bubbles. Space research requires a lot of objective conditions, and these objective conditions are calculated based on decades or even hundreds of years, such as planets connecting in a straight line. This kind of opportunity requires a long wait, and before the astronomical conditions are met, there is very little that humans can do).

I will write about the current AI scams when I have time, which is also a purely rational analysis.

Finally, I want to thank the administrators here. I have been banned in several forums for telling the truth.",2025-05-15 02:30:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kn1g08/purely_rational_tesla_robotaxi_without_l4_isnt/,2025-05-15 02:30:28,"Purely rational: Tesla robotaxi without L4 isn’t even a Challenger — Magic Quadrant shows how far it is from Waymo’s leadership.

Reddit,CoreWeave reports more than 400% growth in its first earnings,"Artificial intelligence infrastructure provider CoreWeave reported better-than-expected revenue on Wednesday in the company’s first earnings release since going public. The company reported revenue of $981.6 million, compared to expectations of $853 million, and -$1.49 EPS.

Revenue soared 420% in the quarter, which ended on March 31, from $188.7 million a year ago, according to a statement. That compares with 737% growth for all of 2024. The company’s net loss of $314.6 million widened from $129.2 million a year earlier, partly because of $177 million in stock-based compensation costs for awards tied to the initial public offering.

CoreWeave sees $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion in 2025 revenue, which implies a growth rate of 363%. That growth requires hefty capital expenditures. The company expects capex of $20 billion to $23 billion for the year. The range includes impact from OpenAI and other factors.

Reddit,Turning Water into Wealth - $LB Landbridge Analysis,"In the past, turning water into wine was considered a biblical miracle. However, with the rise of AI, anyone can now do this incredible feat by investing in Landbridge.

Landbridge is a company that owns land, focusing on the Delaware sub-basin within the Permian Basin. For those unaware, this region is known for having the most active oil and natural gas exploration in the US. If this sounds familiar, its business model and area of activity is similar to the highly successful Teas Pacific ($TPL). However, a massive difference between TPL and LB is LB primarily relies on water royalties for their revenues.

Let's break down their most recent 1Q25 Earnings: [https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc\_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck\_vF.pdf](https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck_vF.pdf)

Revenue came in at $44M, up 131% YoY. 59% came from royalties of land usage. 33% Came from royalties of sales of water/products obtained from land. Only 8% came from royalties from actual Oil & Gas Production. The bulk of these revenues are due to the water needs of high power data centers. As companies continue to develop $10B+ data centers, the access of water is what enables the usage of these centers, creating a continuous revenue opportunity for LB.

The key takeaway is Landbridge does not take on any production/capex risk- it is simply a landowner that allows other companies to operate their production on their assets. This makes it an extremely high margin business, making Visa/Nvidia look inefficient.

The company boasts ""adjusted EBITDA"" margins of 88%. That being said, current GAAP net margins are at 35%, a far cry from the expected 90% management alludes to. This is due to SBC and Interest Expense  due to debt issued to fuel land acquisition. In addition, quarterly FCF is down 40% YoY from $27M to $16M. This is due to a temporary increase in accounts receivable that will be normalized as revenue is recognized.

I personally believe that this is palatable for the moment. There is only so much prime attractive land and I would rather LB acquire it now to generate incredible cash flow in the future. For example, the most recent purchase of Bone Ranch for $245M. This led to a 70% QoQ increase in water royalty volumes and will bring in a MINIMUM of $25M per year for the next 5 years. Again, this is all revenue with essentially 90% margins. These are accretive purchases that will payoff tenfold in the coming years.

As Landbridge continues to engage in accretive M&A to accelerate high margin revenue, the thesis continues to strengthen alongside the growth of water intensive data centers.",2025-05-15 12:53:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1knd5wb/turning_water_into_wealth_lb_landbridge_analysis/,2025-05-15 12:53:00,"Turning Water into Wealth - $LB Landbridge Analysis.

Reddit,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains","Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.

Shares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.

Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.

Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.

In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”

“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”

Investors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.

Additionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.

Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.

Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.

The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.

The department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.

“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.

“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",2025-05-14 10:01:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmfxo2/saudi_arabia_plans_to_spend_billions_of_dollars/,2025-05-14 10:01:36,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains.

Reddit,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains","Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.

Shares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.

Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.

Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.

In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”

“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”

Investors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.

Additionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.

Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.

Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.

The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.

The department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.

“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.

Reddit,$BULL (Webull) dropped from $19 to $12 — Is this support level or just a pause before more downside?,"Hello traders and investors,

I’ve been following $BULL for a while. A week ago, it looked like it had strong upside potential — especially after it ran up to around $19. But since then, it’s been a steady decline, and now it’s hovering just above $12, which seems to be a key support level based on previous price action. (That's just my opinion)

I haven’t seen much recent discussion about it here, so I’m curious:

Is anyone still bullish on $BULL at these levels?

Do you see any catalysts that could reverse this downtrend?

Or is this support likely to break?

Will be great to see informed opinions and maybe some technical or fundamental takes I haven't considered.

There is not much financial info about Webull, or I just can't find it..

Reddit,Microsoft is cutting 3% of all workers,"Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels and geographies.

“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

The company reported better-than-expected results and an upbeat quarterly forecast in late April.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees.

It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.

One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said.

On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July.

Reddit,Tesla Institutional Investor Movement- Mixed Bag- Mostly Positive,"I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the ""smart money"" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the ""smart money"" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.

From the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%. Additionally, the total number of institutional holders increased 1.75%, from 4020 to 4091. Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions. Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).

I don't have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.

*\*I assume these sales are politically motivated to some extent.*

Again, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).

My takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

Reddit,The eToro IPO- Boom or Doom?,"[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.

**Why am I writing these?**

Because I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.

**What is eToro?**

eToro is a ""social trading"" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Launched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.

**Financial Performance**

|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|
|2022|\-$21M|2.8M|\-$43M|

**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**

**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  
**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  
**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  
**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.

**Global User Base**

Europe & UK: \~70% of funded accounts.  
Asia-Pacific: \~16%.  
Americas (U.S. + Latin America): \~10%.  
Middle East & Africa: \~4%.

eToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.

|Primary Geography|Europe/global|U.S.|Global|U.S.|
|Market Cap|\~$4B (IPO target)|\~$55B|\~$65B|\~$6B|

eToro’s valuation (\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.

**Risks:** The F-1 admits that ""Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets"", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and ""Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)"".

So during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. 

Another thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**

**Conclusion**

I don't really see this as a long-term investment because the CFDs are such a prickly point to me. But I do see it as a decent IPO trade that could set up for a great pop if there is enough demand for it. eToro has signaled that its' fate is tied with the crypto markets, and they're currently booming due to the tariff news and the ETH upgrade. So we'll see.

If WeBull is any indication, it might be.

Reddit,The eToro IPO- Boom or Doom?,"[Hi, I like IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/). eToro (ETOR) is another I wanted to post about! eToro isn’t filing an S-1 like U.S.-based companies, it’s a F-1, which serves the same purpose but is for foreign companies listing in the U.S.

**Why am I writing these?**

Because I didn't trade one of the blowout IPOs as well as I expected to, sadly. So this is my penance. Also IPOs are one of the few trades I typically like. eToro planned to IPO in March but but the tariffs have delayed these plans, so we're getting it today.

**What is eToro?**

eToro is a ""social trading"" platform based in Israel. It allows users to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities, and forex while interacting via a social feed (social stock trading). Its standout feature is the CopyTrader system, where users can automatically replicate trades of selected investors. This doesn't exist on any other publicly traded platforms that I know of (please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Launched in 2007, eToro operates in 75+ countries, with its strongest presence in Europe and the UK (about 70% of its funded accounts). It entered the U.S. in 2019 with crypto-only trading but expanded to stocks, ETFs, and options in 2023. As of the end of 2024, eToro had around 3.5 million funded accounts.

|2023|$15M|3.0 M|$117M|
|2022|\-$21M|2.8M|\-$43M|

**Monetization- eToro monetizes through:**

**Spreads:** Main revenue source (around 87% of transaction revenue). Trades are commission-free, but prices include small markups (e.g., up to 1% on crypto). Unlike U.S. brokers like Robinhood, eToro doesn't rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) because it’s banned in most European markets.  
**Currency Conversion Fees:** Charges on forex trades.  
**Interest Income:** Earned on customer cash and crypto balances.  
**Minor Streams:** Premium membership fees, minor platform services.

**Global User Base**

Europe & UK: \~70% of funded accounts.  
Asia-Pacific: \~16%.  
Americas (U.S. + Latin America): \~10%.  
Middle East & Africa: \~4%.

eToro’s European business is dominant. The U.S. market, though expanded since 2023, remains a smaller segment. The US has a lot of competitors (notably HOOD/COIN in the crypto space). They've highlighted mainly options and extended crypto services as an area of expansion.

eToro’s valuation (\~4x 2024 revenue) is moderate relative to its peers. Robinhood and Coinbase have broader brand recognition and larger markets but also higher valuations. The main reason (as I see it) is because the EU is a patchwork of regulations that companies struggle to get compliant with (which is why IBKR is one of the few US brokers that is recommended there). Webull’s recent market activity showed speculative volatility, (we went from $20 to $80 in a single day!) so there is a chance that we pop at open if we're not opening at a ridiculous price.

**Risks:** The F-1 admits that ""Our business is highly dependent on the conditions of the various markets in which we offer our services (such as securities markets, cryptoasset markets, currency markets, commodities markets and payment services markets) and the level of trading activity in such markets"", which means that earnings can vary with levels of trading. They also admit that they are exposed to cryptoassets, and ""Because our Net income (loss) is tied to spreads which are, in certain instances, expressed as a percentage of the value of securities, lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced Net Contribution and Net income (loss)"".

So during times of economic stress/downturn, they fully expect their NI to decrease. 

Another thing to highlight that is a massive risk- [eToro is likely a counterparty for CFDs- as per eToro’s own disclosures, they operate predominantly as **principal**, not agent, meaning they take the other side of the trade.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) This means that eToro is on the hook for margin calls that clients cannot pay, hedging costs and liquidity gaps. **This is extremely concerning to me personally, because this means they profit when you lose, and lose when you profit- which is a massive conflict of interest.**

Reddit,Fintech company Chime files for IPO,"Financial technology company Chime on Tuesday filed paperwork to go public on the Nasdaq. The company intends to file under the ticker symbol “CHYM.”

“Chime is a technology company, not a bank,” the company said in its prospectus, noting it is not a member of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Still, the company cited Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and Wells Fargo as competitors.

According to the filing, Chime picks up revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases that members make with Chime debit cards and credit cards. Banks collect interchange fees, which are generally a percentage of the transaction value, plus a set amount for each transaction depending on the rates determined by card networks such as Visa. The banks then pass money on to Chime.

In the March quarter, Chime generated $12.9 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue. Revenue grew 32%, while profit narrowed from $15.9 million.

At the end of March, Chime had 8.6 million active members, up about 23% year over year. Average revenue per active member, at $251, was up from $231. It has members in all 50 states — it doesn’t operate outside the U.S. — and 55% of them are female. The average member age is 36, according to Chime.

When does the stock buy and sell as a normal stock?  It’s listed on NASDAQ Global Select.  Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",ETOR

Reddit,Is investing in VYM worth it? Any tips/hacks for beginners?,"Pretty much the title. I’m super new to this and I put 100 on the vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF and activated DRIP on the robinhood app so that whichever dividents I receive just get reinvested.

Reddit,Vertiv Could Benefit from the HUMAIN & NVIDIA AI Factory Deal in Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia’s intense summer heat (up to 50°C / 122°F) makes reliable **cooling solutions** a must-have for any high-performance computing infrastructure. Vertiv specializes in **advanced cooling technologies** for data centers, which will be crucial for ensuring these **AI factories** run efficiently without overheating.

In addition to cooling, **uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)** and **power management systems** are essential in a region where power fluctuations and extreme temperatures can lead to outages. Vertiv provides these systems to ensure that the AI supercomputers stay online 24/7, even in the harshest conditions.

Also i like the Company and when u didnt invested in NVIDIA (like me :D), maybe thats a Chance. We will see...

Good Luck.

Reddit,My DD on FLUT,"What's up fellow investors! After diving deep into Flutter Entertainment's financials, analyst ratings, and recent performance, I've put together this comprehensive DD for a buy position in FLUT

 Flutter Entertainment is the world's largest online sports betting and iGaming operator with a portfolio of leading brands including FanDuel, Betfair, Paddy Power, PokerStars, Sky Betting & Gaming, and Sportsbet. The company operates globally with particular strength in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, and Italy.

 Recent Financial Performance
Flutter just released their Q1 2025 results on May 7th, showing continued growth:

Revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $3.67 billion
Average Monthly Players grew 8% to 14.88 million
Net income of $335 million, compared to a net loss of $177 million in Q1 2024 (a 289% improvement)
Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $616 million
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 16.8%

Growth Projections
Analyst consensus for Flutter's growth is extremely bullish:

Revenue growth: 20.45% for FY2025 and 16.08% for FY2026
EPS growth: Dramatic improvement from $0.24 in FY2024 to $9.01 in FY2025 (3,652% increase) and $12.93 in FY2026 (43.6% increase)


Now I am might be an idiot but I have been following lot of other funds and this is their consensus on FLUT

Analyst Sentiment
The Wall Street consensus on FLUT is overwhelmingly positive:

21 analysts covering the stock
Consensus rating: ""Buy"" (20 Buy ratings, 1 Strong Buy rating)
Average price target: $306.28 (26.65% upside from current price)
Price target range: $247 to $350
Recent analyst actions include:

Barclays lowering target from $300 to $293 (May 8, 2025)
Macquarie maintaining Outperform with $340 target (May 8, 2025)
Needham reiterating Buy with $310 target (May 8, 2025)

The ATH in feb 14 was ~$300, so it's all pretty reasonable. I was already part of the wave and now the stocks seems to be in a consolidating position thanks to uncle Trump, so let's join forces to push this one up.",2025-05-14 07:48:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmd427/my_dd_on_flut/,2025-05-14 07:48:26,"My DD on FLUT.

Reddit,"1 Year Later: Revisiting ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection?""","A year ago, I made a post called ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection? $FICO Analysis

[How much are you willing to pay for perfection? $FICO Analysis : r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dgvrzy/how_much_are_you_willing_to_pay_for_perfection/)

Since that post, $FICO has returned 60%, outperforming the SP500 (12%) by 48 pp.

My investment thesis has more or less stayed the same, both in the pros and the cons. We are halfway through the year so I'll have to use TTM data.

**What's changed in the past year:**

As I expected, FICO's revenue growth, net income growth, and margin expansion story has been intact.

TTM Revenue jumped 15% to $1.84B, TTM Net Income grew 20% to $0.57B, and EPS jumped 21.8% to $23.60.

For FY25, Management expects $1.98B Top line, GAAP Net Income to be $0.625B, with GAAP EPS to be $25.05.

**Balance Sheet:**

LT debt has expanded from $2.2B to $2.5B. Shares outstanding have declined 1.5% to 24.9 Million. Management has also announced a $1.5B senior note offering to retire older higher rate debt. I still do not enjoy the amount of leverage on the balance sheet but I'm not in charge of it. Their cash is mostly going towards share buybacks (1.1B repurchased in TTM) which is not that accretive given the multiple.

**PE:**

[Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/a7fV5Pu)

Incredibly enough, FICO has expanded from a 73 PE from my previous post to a 92 PE. To say this is rich is an understatement. The market is clearly pricing in massive margin expansion as well as safety due to no tarriff risk and minimal business failure due to their monopolistic power.

**Closing Remarks:**

I still believe FICO is the closest thing we have to a perfect business. People may believe VantageScore to be a possible disruptor but ultimately, if everyone is using something because they trust their metrics, why risk potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars from poor underwriting to save a few thousand bucks? FICO is still an amazing business, but the multiple leaves little to desire.

Reddit,(05/13) Interesting Stocks Today - United Healthcare CEO Resigns!,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Day 2 of the delayed tariffs- interestingly enough, Trump is now targeting pharma companies over tariffs. 

News[: US Consumer Prices Rose Less Than Expected in April](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-05-13/us-cpi-report-for-april)

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-UnitedHealth Group announced the resignation of CEO Andrew Witty and suspended its 2025 financial outlook due to higher-than-expected medical costs, particularly in its Medicare Advantage segment. Stephen Hemsley, former CEO from 2006 to 2017, is returning to lead the company. The stock dropped nearly 11% in premarket trading. Extremely interested to see if we can break $335, otherwise not interested. Cost pressures were cited to be related to Medicare funding cuts.

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-China lifted a month-long ban on Boeing aircraft deliveries following trade negotiations with the United States, signaling improved relations and resumption of jet deliveries to China. The stock barely moved on this news, so not too interested unless we do some large selloff at the open (past $200). Other stocks related and defense companies didn't move significantly.

[**SE (Sea Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SE&p=d)\-Sea Limited reported adjusted earnings of $0.65 vs $0.60 exp, on revenue of $4.84B vs $4.91B.

Reddit,Thoughts on Block Inc. (NYSE:XYZ)?,"Hello

So Block inc. are the guys who own cashapp. On May 2nd they dipped drastically by almost 20% which was caused by their earnings report. I bought the dip at 47,71$ and May 13th close price was 58,17$. I have 105 stocks. 

So right now I’m up about 1200$ and this is the most money I have made by investing in such a short time as a young investor with about a year of experience. 

Is this stock a potential long term investment or should I cash in now? I’ve only held this for 5 business days. Things I’m worried about are this company’s next earnings report dipping the price again, but then again I bought at such a low price I don’t know if there is actually anything for me to lose by just holding.

Then of course I’m a little hesitant to do long term investments because I have no idea if Trump is gonna go crazy again with the tariffs…

>Apple is weighing price hikes for its upcoming fall iPhone lineup but is keen to avoid linking any increases to U.S. tariffs on imports from China, where most of its devices are assembled, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.

>The technology giant’s shares were up 7% in premarket trading, tracking gains in the wider market after Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily slash the reciprocal tariffs on Monday. But Chinese imports will still be subject to a 30% levy in the U.S.

>Apple is among the most prominent firms caught in U.S.-China trade tensions, which intensified in recent months after a series of tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump.

>The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the WSJ report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

>Raising prices could help Apple cushion higher costs stemming from the tariffs that have hampered global supply chains and forced the company to shift more production to India.

>Apple said earlier this month that tariffs were expected to add about $900 million in costs during the April-June quarter and that it would source a majority of the iPhones sold in the U.S. in the period from India.

>Analysts have for months speculated about a price increase from Apple, but warned that such a move could cost it market share, especially as rivals such as Samsung try to attract consumers with AI features that Apple has been slow to roll out.  
  
The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142 due to tariffs, per projections last month from Rosenblatt Securities, which say the cost could rise by 43%.

Reddit,Megacap tech adds more than $800 billion in market cap after U.S.-China tariff pause,"Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

“With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,” Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.

“This morning is a huge win for the bulls and a best case scenario post this weekend in our view.”

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

“With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,” Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

Reddit,Unexplored $GOOG Bull Case: Hedge against a post AGI world,"There are a lot of bull theses on Google discussed on this sub.  However, none of them touches on the biggest reason to buy $GOOG. 

A post-AGI world is envisioned below:

“machines possessing human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task a human can. This could lead to significant societal shifts, including widespread automation of jobs, potentially altering employment structures and requiring new economic models like Universal Basic Income (UBI)”

Moving further in time, we may even reach ASI and that’s when Singularity is conjectured to occur. But our focus should be on a post AGI world which we are actually currently heading towards.

A post AGI world is very likely to see lost of existing jobs to AI. The counter to this is UBI. However, there is no guarantee UBI will ever occur. This is why investing in $GOOG is highly beneficial to hedge against this possible scenario.

In a post AGI world, there may be many players who are able to provide AGI services. One of the most, if not the most, formidable existing players to gain a significant share of AGI is $GOOG. 

There could potentially be trillions of dollars worth of wages replaced by AGI. On top of that, AGI will likely be used to create even more goods and services than before AGI. Meaning, this could easily become a multi trillion dollar industry. 

Now, if we lose our jobs, and there is no sufficient UBI to raise our living standards, we can at least benefit from a significant increase in our $GOOG investment. 

That means it is a good idea to buy $GOOG even if you believe that Google Search will not be redesigned and gets decimated. View that as a hedge against a post AGI world that many are fearing would happen. A type of insurance. 

$GOOG is definitely one of the best players to invest in for such a scenario. There are just no other public listed companies that can actually go toe to toe against ChatGPT, even the other Mag 7 behemoths. And there are no other companies who has the full stack of technologies required to run a state of the art AI. 

$GOOG’s value is not just as a good business to own, but also as an insurance against a post AGI world.

Reddit,"OpenAI negotiates with Microsoft for new funding and future IPO, FT reports","May 11 (Reuters) - OpenAI and Microsoft are rewriting terms of their multibillion-dollar partnership in a negotiation designed to allow the ChatGPT maker to launch a future IPO, while protecting the software giant's access to cutting-edge AI models, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

A critical issue is how much equity in OpenAI’s new for-profit business Microsoft will receive in exchange for the more than $13 billion it has invested in the company to date, the report said. It said Microsoft is offering to give up some of its equity stake in exchange for access to new technology developed beyond the 2030 cutoff.

They are also revising terms of a wider contract, first drafted when Microsoft initially invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019, the report said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.OpenAI has told investors it will share a smaller fraction of revenue with its largest backer as it moves ahead with restructuring, The Information reported last week. In January, Microsoft changed some terms of a deal with OpenAI after entering a joint venture with Oracle and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new artificial intelligence data centers in the U.S.

I have around 12k and just went back to 0 profit ( no loss or profit ), I'm wondering if I should clear my position and buy gold instead, specifically GLD since It's been doing very great since the world is a mess right now.

I feel like I'm gonna regret it if I don't, thank you",2025-05-13 04:39:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1klgxdz/should_i_sell_my_sp500_etf_holdings_and_buy_gld/,2025-05-13 04:39:03,"Should I sell my S&P500 ETF holdings and buy GLD instead.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.



2020 trading year was kinda randomly getting out of control:

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Reddit,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

**Looking back I laugh at the stock picks & strategies I did, and I'm glad I'm done with that. I found my strategy that suits me and gives me peace of mind.  Hope you guys find it too**",PLTR

Reddit,Is My Broker Stealing From Me?,"As an additional strategy, I have been watching for reverse split arbitrage opportunities. I've been doing this for about 18 months now, and while it's  typically only a few bucks each trade, it's better than nothing. The big boys game the system for profit, so why can't I? 

How I do this is I'll scan a daily list announcing upcoming splits. I filter for reverse splits, then read the company filing for how they treat fractional shares. If they say they will round up, then I purchase one share and wait. This has worked well for me for the first year, but not anymore. Aside from the fact that less issuers are rounding up, my broker keeps paying me cash in lieu of.

I know that corporate actions are processed according to instructions given to the DTC from the issuer and can be at the participant or beneficial holder level. The majority of tickers I've done this with state something like, ""stockholders that own shares in street name with a broker or bank will be treated the same as those that hold registered shares in book-entrty form.""

This tells me that if fractional shares are to be rounded up, then I should get one whole share. How do I, or anyone for that matter, know if the broker is not collecting all the whole shares that belong to the clients and just payout the fractional amount in cash? 

I have asked, through customer support chats because getting someone on the phone is difficult at best, and the answer I get is always that ""cash is paid in lieu of fractional shares."" Even when I've provided links that say otherwise. Any advice? Do I report to Finra? The brokers are Fidelity and Robinhood.

Reddit,Warren Buffett’s 1965 investors: From $100 to $5.5 million By Investing.com,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKb) remains one of the most extraordinary success stories in corporate and investment history. From humble beginnings, a $100 investment in Berkshire shares back in 1965—when Buffett took control—would have grown to $5.5 million by the end of last year, according to the company’s own figures.

That compares to just $39,000 had the same amount been placed in an S&P 500 index fund with dividends reinvested. The gap illustrates not just outperformance, but a staggering wealth-creation machine that has compounded investor capital at roughly double the rate of the market for six decades.


“The one problem with the investment business is that things don’t come along in an orderly fashion, and they never will,” Buffett said at the most recent annual shareholder meeting. “We’re running a business which is very, very, very opportunistic.”

In a year in which he decided to finally step down as the company’s CEO, Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio reflects Buffett’s enduring investment principles: a focus on companies with strong fundamentals, long-term growth potential, and a commitment to holding investments over extended periods.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKb) remains one of the most extraordinary success stories in corporate and investment history. From humble beginnings, a $100 investment in Berkshire shares back in 1965—when Buffett took control—would have grown to $5.5 million by the end of last year, according to the company’s own figures.

That compares to just $39,000 had the same amount been placed in an S&P 500 index fund with dividends reinvested. The gap illustrates not just outperformance, but a staggering wealth-creation machine that has compounded investor capital at roughly double the rate of the market for six decades.

Reddit,Trump has threatened to place a 100% tariff on Barbie maker Mattel,"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-threatens-barbie-100-percent-tariff-2070023

> President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports. ""I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' "" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market."" Trump's threat to Mattel comes as toys—in particular dolls—have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy.

> Trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers.

> During the company's first-quarter earnings call, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three ""mitigating actions"" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on China-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: ""We don't see that happening."" ""We believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,"" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: ""I think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me.""

Reddit,Anyone see issues with this formula,"Been a technical trader but trying to learn fundamental analysis so first thought I’d do one on a position I already have, SunRun (RUN) 
- P/E: N/A

- Total assets minus total liabilities: 4.1B
- Market cap: 1.94B
- Current stock price: 9.38

Please don’t roast me too much but here’s the formula I came up with and some reasoning 

Total assets (20.38) minus total liabilities(16.28) equals 4.1 divided by market cap (1.94) equals 2.11. Stock price of 9.38 multiplied by 2.11 equals *$19.79* is what I’m valuing the stock at. I did this because if the stock is trading at $9.38 with a market cap of 1.94B but total assets minus total liabilities is 4.1B, then theoretically it’s trading at a discount right? Or no? I’m not taking earnings and stuff into account here, but  just one formula that I was looking at, what do you all think?

Here’s the simplified formula i used (order of operations doesn’t apply here, you’d use the formula exactly left to right)

Reddit,CrowdStrike Faces Federal Investigation: Stock Tumbles Amid Government Probe into $32M IRS Deal,"CrowdStrike, a leading name in cybersecurity, saw its stock tumble this week following reports of a federal investigation into a major government contract. The probe centers around a $32 million software deal tied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), sparking investor concerns about the company’s business practices and future government partnerships.

According to sources close to the matter, the Department of the Treasury’s inspector general is investigating the role [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) played in a procurement process that allegedly skipped competitive bidding rules. The deal was executed through Carahsoft, a major government IT contractor, and involved CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software being fast-tracked into IRS systems.

The issue? Investigators are trying to determine if the deal improperly bypassed [federal acquisition regulations](https://www.acquisition.gov/), which require fair competition for most government contracts. So far, no formal accusations have been made, but the existence of an active investigation is enough to rattle stakeholders.

Once news of the probe broke, CrowdStrike’s stock dropped by nearly 5% in intraday trading. The sharp decline reflects investor anxiety over potential reputational damage, contract delays, or future revenue losses tied to government scrutiny.

This development comes at a time when CrowdStrike is viewed as a major player in protecting public and private institutions from cyber threats. Any disruption to that perception could shift market dynamics in favor of competitors.

# What This Means for the Cybersecurity Industry

Government contracts are a huge revenue source for cybersecurity firms. But as this situation highlights, they can also come with regulatory risks. The scrutiny CrowdStrike now faces serves as a warning to other tech firms: follow proper procurement procedures, or face financial and legal consequences.

Analysts say this probe might not spell long-term doom for CrowdStrike, especially if no wrongdoing is ultimately found. Still, it’s a reminder that trust and transparency are as critical as innovation in today’s tech-driven economy.",2025-05-09 19:14:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kiw51u/crowdstrike_faces_federal_investigation_stock/,2025-05-09 19:14:54,"CrowdStrike Faces Federal Investigation: Stock Tumbles Amid Government Probe into $32M IRS Deal.

Reddit,Lets do some math for retail companies and more,"The margin for a healthy, **sustainable** EBITDA for a retail company needs to be around **10%**, because after the **gross margin**—which ideally is around **55%**—all other costs like rent, labor, storage, IT, corporate structure, etc., **consume** more than 45%. This **leaves approximately 10% EBITDA** for a well-run retail company.

Now, even if you take the best-case scenario—**a 10% tariff on all imports** (which is what even the UK has after its ""historic"" deal with the US)—that 45% cost becomes **49.5%** (**45 × 1.1**), reducing retail companies’ EBITDA to approximately  under **6%**.

However, not all retail companies in the US are healthy—**many are on the brink of bankruptcy with average EBITDA under 7%**. Even Walmart, a volume-driven company and considered one of the healthiest low-cost retailers in the world, has an EBITDA of approximately **6%**. 

And now, **who still thinks we aren't headed for a recession in Q2 and Q3?** When do you think orders are placed for Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas? **Six months in advance.** And here we are, holding all orders or even if placing orders now with goods sitting in Chinese warehouses instead of being **in transit** as they should be.

You will not only see **fewer products on shelves**, but also **reduced consumer spending and layoffs**. If retailers don’t close **10–25% of their stores by year-end**, they will not survive the expense load. **Imagine every retailer overdrafting their accounts—just like consumers spending beyond their bank balance with no clear plan to repay.**

Reddit,Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies — its earnings multiple is astronomical,"There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.

“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”

Reddit,Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies — its earnings multiple is astronomical,"There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Reddit,Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies — its earnings multiple is astronomical,"There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.

“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”

Reddit,Land 156 - Mission Syracuse - Droneshield?,"**With both Mission Syracuse and LAND 156 gaining traction, which defence companies are best placed to win short-term contracts in counter-drone and force protection technologies?**

Mission Syracuse, led by the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator (ASCA), is actively sourcing deployable counter-UAS capabilities to protect ADF personnel, especially in contested or forward-deployed environments.

LAND 156 is the Army's modernization program focused on improving close combat effectiveness, including soldier protection, situational awareness, and survivability, domains where electronic warfare, drone defence, and integrated sensing are increasingly central.

Looking for thoughts on which Australian or allied defence players (including smaller or dual-use tech firms) are realistically positioned to secure contracts in the near term, especially those with field-ready solutions or existing ADF relationships. My guess on purely australian plays are EOS and Droneshield. Do I miss some companies? Any DD, signals, or educated speculation appreciated.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Reddit,Ford CEO calls for ‘comprehensive' tariff analysis for all countries,"* Ford CEO Jim Farley on Wednesday called for a ""comprehensive"" look at U.S. tariffs involving automobiles to level the playing field for the American automaker.
* Farley singled out imports from Japan and South Korea that have little to no duties compared with the 25% tariff President Donald Trump has threatened Canada and Mexico with in recent weeks.
* Farley's comments follow Trump implementing a 10% additional tariff on goods from China as well as ongoing negotiations with Canada and Mexico involving 25% levies on imports.

Reddit,Swede here I'm short Tesla,"So their earnings were bad 
Brand is in the toilet 

The consumer base that bought these cars 
now would rather burn them 

Large drops in sales in the whole world. 

Recall on almost the whole Cybertruck fleet. 

A CEO that wants a 30 billion dollar payday? Spent the last 6 months burning the brand to the ground. 

Sells 5% of the cars in the world has half of the total market share of all auto companies in the world 

Other brands like BYD, VW etc having better tech, cars and batteries.

Looming Tarrifs on everything that Tesla needs to build cars. 

A new Semi expansion in a market where shipping to the US is down 39% and won't get up unless all Tarrifs just go away. Also with no infrastructure to support it and a administration that has no plans to spend a dime on EV infrastructure. 

Millions of self-driving taxis by second half of 2026? What? 

It's up 23% over the last month, can someone explain this to me? Now my bearish bet is 1 July price target $220 anything close to it and I'm green, under and I'm minted. 

Should I just eat the loss and move on? It's probably going to smack into $290 and go down again but still.

Kongsberg Gruppen (KOG) recently reported stellar Q1 2025 results, with an 81% increase in EBITDA and a 63% rise in order intake, driven by heightened demand for defense systems amid escalating geopolitical tensions.

However, shortly after these impressive results, DNB Markets downgraded KOG to a 'sell' rating, causing the stock to decline.

This move is particularly puzzling given that DNB Asset Management is among the top 20 shareholders in Kongsberg Gruppen, holding approximately 1.02% of the company. 

The timing of the downgrade raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. Is DNB attempting to drive down the stock price for strategic reasons?

Reddit,BREAKING: Trump to Rescind Chip Curbs After Debate Over AI Rules,"The Trump administration plans to rescind Biden-era AI chip curbs as part of a broader effort to revise semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn strong opposition from major tech companies and foreign governments, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Trump administration will not enforce the so-called AI diffusion rule when it takes effect on May 15, the people said.

Reddit,Got the biggest kick to my psyche's nuts in perhaps my entire life,"My mother recently passed and my dad is hanging on in memory care. I'm now running the family trust and so know all of my parent's holdings. Anyways I was going through copious amounts of files and yesterday finally took a closer look at a letter my dad wrote to us on 1/15/2007 before a trip they took up the Amazon, in case something bad happened I could start getting at the money.

3100 shares of NFLX (~$70k)

We don't own either of those in the trust. Sold at some point perhaps years ago definitely before the extreme run-ups of the 2020's. Probably sold after making several hundred thousand or when they didn't move the right direction.

His Goal is Mars. But rocketlab:
- is a company listed on the Stock Market (so WE can participate)
- its goal is business/making Money

So how can rocketlab make lot of money in Future? I think they will mine ressources from asteroids. So while musk travel to Mars and burn billions with SpaceX, rocketlab will make billions with mined Minerals from Asteroids some day... I HODL this Stock for decades and Im Sure this Stock will hit trillions of Market Cap in 20-30 years... Thats why I invest every month in it.

Reddit,Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL),"We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. 

I'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just ""Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars."" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... 

I'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! 

Edit: I'll start with mine. 

Search- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.

YouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.

Cloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. 

Google networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.

Other -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?

Balance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? 

So, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time.

Reddit,Nintendo forecasts sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles as it gears up for launch,"Nintendo said Thursday that it expects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026.

It is the first forecast for sales from the Japanese gaming giant since it announced the successor to its successful Switch device, which is due to go on sale in June.

Nintendo also reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full year. Here’s how Nintendo did in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Mar. 31 versus LSEG estimates:

* **Revenue**: 208.7 billion Japanese yen ($1.45 billion), compared with 216.16 billion yen expected.
* **Net profit:** 41.6 billion yen, versus 33.91 billion yen expected.

Revenue fell 24.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, while profit plunged nearly 50%. This was largely expected as Nintendo fans await the Switch 2 and hold off on buying the current console.

Earlier this year Nintendo slashed its forecast for sales of the Switch to 11 million units for the year ended Mar. 31. Nintendo on Thursday said it sold 10.8 million units of the Switch in the year, just shy of its own forecast and down 31% year-on-year.

Market research firm Omdia expects Nintendo to sell 14.7 million Switch 2 units in 2025 alone, which would be about 10% ahead of the original Switch’s debut year.

“Switch 2 will launch into a stronger position than its predecessor, with over 100 million active Switch users providing a strong foundation for adoption,” George Jijiashvili, Omdia’s senior principal analyst, told CNBC by email.

# Tariffs in focus

Investors are also focused on Nintendo’s forecast for the fiscal year. The company expects net sales of 1.9 trillion yen, a 63% year-on-year rise but just short of LSEG estimates of 2 trillion yen. It expects net profit to jump 7.6% to 300 billion yen, below LSEG estimates of 388.8 billion yen.

However, Nintendo noted that all of its forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective Apr. 10 — following a pause in U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs for many countries.

Nintendo in April delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. Nintendo’s consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, which faces duties of 46% once the pause lifts.

Nintendo’s President Shuntaro Furukawa said on Thursday that if additional tariffs are imposed and prices of its goods need to be adjusted, demand in the U.S. may decrease, Reuters reported. Duties could hit profit to the tune of tens of billions of yen, Furukawa added, according to the report.

Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games, said Nintendo’s forecasts are typically conservative.

“Nintendo loves lowballing their forecasts, and the current climate around tariffs gives them all the reason to be more cautious than ever,” Toto told CNBC.

He added that tariffs are creating an “unclear future” for Nintendo, making it “impossible” for any hardware maker to make sales predictions.

“What happens if the tariffs on imports from China stay this high for longer or if they are raised for Vietnam?” Toto said.

“If Nintendo needed to raise prices by $100 or more, all bets would be off and the company would be under enormous pressure in the all important U.S. market.”

# Switch 2 fuels stock rally

Investors are now focused on how the successor to the console, the Switch 2, will perform following its launch. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and has improved features compared with its predecessor.

As well as the 15 million unit sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, Nintendo said it expects to sell 45 million units of software during the same period.

Games are important for the success of any console and Nintendo said the Switch 2 will launch with two titles — “Mario Kart World” and “Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour.” There will also be Switch 2 versions of existing games such as “Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Nintendo is leaning on its popular characters such as Mario and Zelda to boost the appeal of the Switch 2.

Nintendo first launched the original Switch in 2017 and it has become the Japanese gaming giant’s second-best-selling console ever with over 150 million units sold. The firm managed to extend the life of the hardware thanks to hit games involving characters like Super Mario, franchises such as Pokemon and the expansion of its intellectual property into films.

Investors are hopeful the company can continue to ride its wave of popularity with shares up around 30% this year and 64% over the past 12 months.

Reddit,Coca-Cola Company (KO) shareowners reject anti-DEI activist investor proposals,"Coke (KO) shareowners last Wednesday, April 30 rejected various right-wing activist investor proposals by a wide margin (95 - 99%).

Some of the rhetoric used in the proposals was downright insane:

""First, the Company appears to be all in
on agendas that many Americans believe are radical and leftist, including embracing utopian
environmental goals, dividing employees on the basis of race and sex in the name of DEI, and
scoring 100% on the human right campaign Corporate Equality Index, which has been described
as a woke credit scoring system that promotes transgenderism.""

""But one would truly have to have one's head in the sand to conclude that the
concerns proponent raises about ESG, DEI, and transgenderism are isolated and merely
perceived by the proponent who happens to be a shareholder. Note, as just one example, the
growing list of companies and brands that have recently done an about face on one or more
of these issues. The fact that Coke can be so dismissive of these concerns is itself indicative of
the need for the committee and report the proposal requests.""

""Nearly all of
corporate America has recognized that DEI policies have become toxic and rejected by most
consumers in the United States, but Coca-Cola still clings to these discriminatory practices. For
example, Coke's top competitor, PepsiCo, eliminated DEI-based executive incentives, and we
withdrew our proposal there.""

https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/no-evidence-coca-cola-reported-immigrant-workers-ice-2025-02-14/",2025-05-07 08:11:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kgvrra/cocacola_company_ko_shareowners_reject_antidei/,2025-05-07 08:11:13,"Coca-Cola Company (KO) shareowners reject anti-DEI activist investor proposals. Coke (KO) shareowners last Wednesday, April 30 rejected various right-wing activist investor proposals by a wide margin (95 - 99%).

Some of the rhetoric used in the proposals was downright insane:

""First, the Company appears to be all in
on agendas that many Americans believe are radical and leftist, including embracing utopian
environmental goals, dividing employees on the basis of race and sex in the name of DEI, and
scoring 100% on the human right campaign Corporate Equality Index, which has been described
as a woke credit scoring system that promotes transgenderism.""

""But one would truly have to have one's head in the sand to conclude that the
concerns proponent raises about ESG, DEI, and transgenderism are isolated and merely
perceived by the proponent who happens to be a shareholder. Note, as just one example, the
growing list of companies and brands that have recently done an about face on one or more
of these issues. The fact that Coke can be so dismissive of these concerns is itself indicative of
the need for the committee and report the proposal requests.""

""Nearly all of
corporate America has recognized that DEI policies have become toxic and rejected by most
consumers in the United States, but Coca-Cola still clings to these discriminatory practices. For
example, Coke's top competitor, PepsiCo, eliminated DEI-based executive incentives, and we
withdrew our proposal there.""

Reddit,Warner Bros Discovery misses revenue estimates on box office weakness,"https://stocks.apple.com/AV2Irp1ZHQ2eG8M_0a9BnNg

Summary
Quarterly studios revenue declines 18% after 'Mickey 17' underperforms
Streaming subscriber gains of 5.3 million far exceed estimates
Cable TV unit revenue falls 7% as cord-cutting continues
Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) missed first-quarter revenue estimates on Thursday, weighed down by a lack of big box office hits from its studios and weakness in its traditional TV business as consumers continued to abandon cable for streaming.
Like others in the media business, Warner Bros Discovery is losing thousands of cable TV subscribers each year, putting pressure on the company to consistently produce hit content and boost profitability in its streaming business.
The threat of U.S. tariffs on foreign-made films has also added to the headaches of an industry whose biggest-budget films are often produced across several continents.
WBD struggled in the January-March quarter to replicate the success of last year's ""Dune: Part Two,"" which grossed more than $700 million. The company's marquee release for the period, Bong Joon Ho's sci-fi dark comedy ""Mickey 17,"" earned only slightly more than its reported budget at the box office.
That meant studios revenue fell 18% to $2.31 billion, missing estimates of $2.73 billion, according to Visible Alpha.
The company has, however, made a strong start to the second quarter with Ryan Coogler's horror film ""Sinners"" and the blockbuster ""A Minecraft Movie,"" which has raked in around $900 million globally, making it the biggest release of 2025 so far. Its summer lineup also looks strong with ""Superman,"" directed by Marvel's long-time hitmaker James Gunn, set to release in July.
Revenue at the TV networks segment, which includes CNN, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, fell 7%, with advertising revenue in the business declining 12% as marketers avoided cable TV amid cord-cutting by subscribers.
Overall, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of 2025 to $8.98 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $9.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Loss of 18 cents per share was also larger than expectations for a 13-cent loss, even as costs declined 11.8%.
The company's shares were down 1.9% in premarket trading.
Still, its streaming business was a bright spot.
WBD added 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, compared with 3.1 million estimated by analysts, according to Visible Alpha, taking its total to 122.3 million. The quarter featured some strong content slate including the third season of HBO's ""The White Lotus"" and the medical drama series ""The Pitt"".
The company also launched its Max streaming service in Australia earlier this year, following rollouts in more than 70 countries across Europe and Asia last year. Analysts say it has also benefited and reduced churn thanks to a streaming bundle combining Disney+, Hulu and Max that was introduced last year.

Reddit,How does inflow/ outflow work?,"I am trying to learn and understand how inflows and outflows technically work and how they relate to the underlying price and changes therewithin. for example SPY had net outflows during periods it increased in price and net inflows as it was decreasing in price.

how is this possible and how would it work? how could there technically even be inflows or outflows of $ if every transaction includes a buy and a sell, technically wouldnt it be even, ie if i buy spy at $570, someone must be selling it at $570 so there shouldnt be any money going in or out ?

  
\* reddit cut off the rest of my question:

and if that means simply when i buy its a net inflow of $570, why would the price move upwards on days where there are net OUT flows and move down on days where there are net inflows? i am not getting how this is possible.

Reddit,Cathie Wood on CNBC this morning,"Just watched Andrew Ross Sorkin’s interview with Cathie Wood who manages the ARK Fund. The segment was about “finding opportunity”. Her optimism about Tesla, Bitcoin, and this administration’s approach to tariffs and global tax cuts was so positive that I questioned her credibility. Here are some highlights of the interview.

She spoke of all “the letters” her firm puts out. Highlights:

1. Says we are in recession now and sees end of rolling recession very soon
2. Govt Productivity increase is staggering
3. Palintir - recent report was “fantastic”. strategic decision for companies and growing although Europe is slow on uptake of AI. Alex Karp said Europe is hopeless. But maybe that changes she says. I own Palintir stock. 
4. Bitcoin new target (2030) - $750k to $1.5 M. Might replace Gold as hedge. Wow!
5. Tesla- $2600 by 2030. What? Robots, Energy Storage, and AI
6. Google News re AI and models take share from Google. She thinks Google is underestimating the negative impact to them

She expects interest rates to come down. Bullish overall.

Reddit,Cathie Wood on CNBC this morning,"Just watched Andrew Ross Sorkin’s interview with Cathie Wood who manages the ARK Fund. The segment was about “finding opportunity”. Her optimism about Tesla, Bitcoin, and this administration’s approach to tariffs and global tax cuts was so positive that I questioned her credibility. Here are some highlights of the interview.

She spoke of all “the letters” her firm puts out. Highlights:

1. Says we are in recession now and sees end of rolling recession very soon
2. Govt Productivity increase is staggering
3. Palintir - recent report was “fantastic”. strategic decision for companies and growing although Europe is slow on uptake of AI. Alex Karp said Europe is hopeless. But maybe that changes she says. I own Palintir stock. 
4. Bitcoin new target (2030) - $750k to $1.5 M. Might replace Gold as hedge. Wow!
5. Tesla- $2600 by 2030. What? Robots, Energy Storage, and AI
6. Google News re AI and models take share from Google. She thinks Google is underestimating the negative impact to them

She expects interest rates to come down. Bullish overall.

Reddit,EU Plans to Hit Boeing With Tariffs If US Trade Talks Fail,"The European Union will propose tariffs on Boeing Co. aircraft if talks with the US fail to de-escalate a brewing trade conflict, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm that handles trade matters, has been meeting with US officials ever since Trump last month announced a 20% universal tariff — reduced to 10% until July — on nearly all EU exports. He also imposed a 25% levy on cars and metals.

Reddit,Trump to Rescind Global AI Curbs,"From Bloomberg:

The Trump administration plans to rescind some Biden-era AI chip curbs as part of a broader effort to revise global semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn strong opposition from major tech companies and foreign governments.

The repeal of the so-called AI diffusion rule, which is not yet final, seeks to refashion a policy launched under President Joe Biden that created three broad tiers of countries for regulating the export of chips from Nvidia Corp. and others. The Trump administration will not enforce that framework when it takes effect on May 15, according to people familiar with the matter, and is instead drafting its own version of the rules that’s likely to focus on direct negotiations with nations like the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia.

The policy debate, which remains ongoing, centers on the question of how to regulate semiconductor shipments to places outside of China. Both Trump and Biden officials have sought to crack down on Beijing’s semiconductor ambitions, over concerns that advanced chip and AI technology could lend China a military edge. 

Scrapping the AI diffusion framework won’t change the measures targeting China, which Trump recently toughened. Rather, it would provide fresh opportunities for other countries to negotiate their own chip access, as governments around the world seek to develop domestic AI capabilities. Those deals could be influenced by investment promises or broader trade and diplomatic considerations.

so my thought is, with ROOT's monster earnings announced yesterday with a 4000%+ beat in EPS and 42M+ rev beat, 80m QoQ growth in written premiums, the accounting of warrants by CVNA,  and the suspicious shelf offering announced in q1, it feels like CVNA may be gearing up to exercise those 180-216 warrants. if that is the case, shouldn't we see ROOT trade significantly higher than 216 soon? what do you guys think?",2025-05-08 06:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1khmjja/root_cvna_monster_er_beat/,2025-05-08 06:16:05,"ROOT & CVNA Monster ER beat?.

The company lost money for 3 years straight and people predicted that they would follow SEGA and go third party. Instead of doing what most companies do, their CEO, the late great Satoru Iwata took a pay cut of 50%, did not layoff anyone and focused on revolutionizing the market again with the ""hybrid"" known at the time as the NX. 

They caved to shareholders by creating games for mobile, but they never truly explored the market. They did that to give them a breathing room while they focused on their magnus opus. Iwata died in the midst of that due to cancer, but the new leadership stuck with the plan. 

10 years later, the NX, now known as Switch, revolutionized the gaming industry, revitalized the handheld market and is about to surpass the PS2 as the best selling console of all time.

Reddit,Arm shares drop on weak forecast,"Arm shares dropped more than 8% in extended trading on Wednesday after the chip-design company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with LSEG consensus:

* Earnings per share: 55 cents, adjusted vs. 52 cents expected
* Revenue: $1.24 billion vs. $1.23 billion

While Arm topped estimates for the quarter ended March 31, Wall Street is looking ahead to the company’s forecast for the first quarter.

Arm said revenue will be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. The middle of the range is below the $1.1 billion average analysts estimated, according to LSEG. Earnings per share will be between 30 cents and 38 cents, while analysts were expecting 42 cents.

SoftBank controls about 90% of Arm, and took the company public in 2023. It now has a market cap of over $130 billion as of Wednesday’s close.

Arm designs the fundamental architecture upon which many chips are built, and sells licenses for its designs to companies such as Qualcomm and Nvidia, charging royalty fees on each sale they make. The company claims 99% of premium smartphones are powered by Arm technology.

Royalty revenue in the quarter rose 18% from a year earlier to $607 million.

Net income fell 6% to $210 million, or 20 cents a share, from $224 million, or 21 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue jumped 34% from $928 million a year earlier.

Reddit,Amazon buys the dip in AMD shares as per their 13F Filing,"Looks like Amazon just made a move on AMD. According to their latest 13F filing, they acquired 822,234 shares, valued at around $84.4 million.

Interesting timing, especially with AMD ramping up its AI chip game and pushing deeper into data centers. Feels like Amazon might be hedging its bets or maybe doubling down on AI infrastructure for AWS.

With all the recent volatility in semiconductors, maybe Amazon sees this as an opportunity to grab strong positioning while others are selling off.

What do you guys think? Smart move or just another corporate hedge?

Reddit,Uber misses revenue expectations with trips up 18% over last year,"Uber reported first-quarter results Wednesday that beat analysts’ expectations for earnings, but fell shy of anticipated revenue growth for the quarter. Shares fell about 5% following the report.

Here’s how Uber did versus analysts’ estimates compiled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 83 cents vs. 50 cents expected.
* **Revenue:** $11.53 billion vs. $11.62 billion expected.

Revenue at the ride-sharing company grew about 14% in the first three months of 2025, up from $10.13 billion during the same period in 2024.

The company also reported net income of around $1.78 billion or 83 cents per share during the first three months of 2025, up from a net loss of $654 million, or a loss of 32-cent loss per share, during the first quarter of 2024.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and CFO ‭Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said they expect gross bookings to reach between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion during the current quarter, with EBITDA in the range of $2.02 billion to $2.12 billion for that period.

In April, the Federal Trade Commission sued Uber and accused the company of “deceptive billing and cancellation practices” around its subscription service called Uber One.

“It’s a bit of a head-scratcher for us,” Khosrowshahi told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.

He said 60% of the company’s gross bookings in its Uber Eats business come from Uber One members, and that the subscription service is growing quickly.

“The suit alleges that some people don’t realize that they’re signing up or cancellations are difficult, but I’d encourage you to go experience it yourself,” Khosrowshahi said. “It’s very, very simple. You take a couple of steps to be able to cancel if you want.”

Uber’s largest business segments, which include its ride-hailing business and food and grocery delivery service, saw bookings increase year-over-year.

Here are the key segment numbers:

* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $21.18 billion, up 13% year over year
* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $20.38 billion, up 15% year over year

The company also said its “monthly active platform consumers,” had grown to 170 million, up 14% from the first quarter of last year. Users booked around 3.04 billion “trips” during the first quarter of 2025, up 18% from the first quarter of 2024.

Uber told employees at the end of April that they would have to come into the office three days a week instead of two, including some remote staffers. The company also announced changes to its month-long paid sabbatical benefit, raising the requirement from five years at the company to eight years. 

Khosrowshahi defended the policy changes at a heated all-hands meeting last week, as CNBC previously reported.

“Our company is executing really well, but we need to be at our top of our game and that means people working together in the office,” he told CNBC on Wednesday.

Uber has also been making a push into autonomous vehicles, or AV technology. Khosrowshahi said the company views AVs as “the single greatest opportunity ahead for Uber.”

Uber allows app users to book robotaxi rides in some U.S. markets, or order food for delivery via autonomous vehicle in others.

Khosrowshahi said Uber reached an “annual run-rate” of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.

In March, the company began to offer users in Austin, Texas the option to hail a robotaxi from its partner, Alphabet-owned Waymo exclusively via the Uber platform.

Khosrowshahi said the Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as far as completed trips per day.

Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta.

“Supported by the consistent strength of our core business, we continue to build towards the future, including five new autonomous vehicle announcements in just the last week,” Khosrowshahi said in a release.

“The suit alleges that some people don’t realize that they’re signing up or cancellations are difficult, but I’d encourage you to go experience it yourself,” Khosrowshahi said. “It’s very, very simple. You take a couple of steps to be able to cancel if you want.”

Uber’s largest business segments, which include its ride-hailing business and food and grocery delivery service, saw bookings increase year-over-year.

Here are the key segment numbers:

* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $21.18 billion, up 13% year over year
* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $20.38 billion, up 15% year over year

The company also said its “monthly active platform consumers,” had grown to 170 million, up 14% from the first quarter of last year. Users booked around 3.04 billion “trips” during the first quarter of 2025, up 18% from the first quarter of 2024.

Uber told employees at the end of April that they would have to come into the office three days a week instead of two, including some remote staffers. The company also announced changes to its month-long paid sabbatical benefit, raising the requirement from five years at the company to eight years. 

Khosrowshahi defended the policy changes at a heated all-hands meeting last week, as CNBC previously reported.

“Our company is executing really well, but we need to be at our top of our game and that means people working together in the office,” he told CNBC on Wednesday.

Uber has also been making a push into autonomous vehicles, or AV technology. Khosrowshahi said the company views AVs as “the single greatest opportunity ahead for Uber.”

Uber allows app users to book robotaxi rides in some U.S. markets, or order food for delivery via autonomous vehicle in others.

Khosrowshahi said Uber reached an “annual run-rate” of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.

In March, the company began to offer users in Austin, Texas the option to hail a robotaxi from its partner, Alphabet-owned Waymo exclusively via the Uber platform.

Khosrowshahi said the Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as far as completed trips per day.

Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta.

“Supported by the consistent strength of our core business, we continue to build towards the future, including five new autonomous vehicle announcements in just the last week,” Khosrowshahi said in a release.

Reddit,"Disney reports surprise uptick in streaming subscribers, beats on top and bottom lines","Disney posted fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines, boosted by better-than-expected subscriber growth for its Disney+ streaming platform. 

The company upped some of its fiscal 2025 guidance and posted revenue growth in all three of its business segments.

Shares of Disney gained about 6% in premarket trading Wednesday.

Disney, which had previously said it expected Disney+ subscribers to decline during the quarter, reported a 1.4 million increase in subscriptions to its flagship service, bringing its global base to 126 million. Wall Street had expected Disney to report 123.35 million Disney+ subscribers, according to StreetAccount.

Revenue for its direct-to-consumer business rose to $6.12 billion, up 8% compared with the same period a year prior. Higher prices and increased subscriber numbers led to the growth, the company said.

Here is what Disney reported for the period ended March 29 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.45 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected
* **Revenue:** $23.62 billion vs. $23.14 billion

Adjusting for one-time items, including the resolution of a tax matter, among other items, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.45. 

Disney’s overall revenue was up 7% year over year to $23.62 billion.

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks, direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 9% year over year to $10.68 billion after a strong carryover from winter film titles.

While “Snow White” and “Captain America: Brave New World” underperformed, ticket sales from 2024 releases “Mufasa: The Lion King” and “Moana 2″ buoyed content sales and licensing. 

Linear continued to drag on overall results, with revenue falling 13% to $2.42 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, rose 5% to $4.53 billion on higher advertising revenue. The company aired three additional College Football Playoff games and one extra National Football League game during the quarter, leading to higher ad rates and viewership.

For fiscal 2025, Disney said Wednesday it expects its sports segment’s operating income growth will be up 18% year over year, higher than the 13% growth it had previously forecast.

Over at its experiences business, which includes parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products, revenue rose 6% during the quarter to $8.89 billion.

Its domestic theme parks saw revenue rise 9% to $6.5 billion, while international park revenues dipped 5% to $1.44 billion.

The company attributed revenue gains to higher guest spend at its domestic parks and higher volumes on its cruise ships following the launch of the Disney Treasure.

Reddit,AMD earnings beat as overall sales surge 36%,"Advanced Micro Devices reported first fiscal-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped expectations, and provided a strong forecast for current-quarter revenue.

Shares of AMD rose more than 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended March 29:

* **Earnings per share**: 96 cents adjusted vs. 94 cents expected
* **Revenue**: $7.44 billion vs. $7.13 billion expected

For the current quarter, AMD expects about $7.4 billion in sales with a gross margin of 43%, versus Wall Street estimates for earnings of 86 cents adjusted on $7.25 billion in sales.

AMD’s forecast also included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company’s artificial intelligence chips during the quarter.

The company reported net income of $709 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, versus net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 36% on an annual basis.

AMD is the second-place server central processing unit vendor, behind Intel, but its Epyc line of processors has been taking market share in recent years.

The company is also the closest competitor to Nvidia for “big GPUs,” or graphics processing units. Those are the kind of chips that are deployed in data centers by the thousands for building generative AI. It did $5 billion in AI GPU sales in the company’s fiscal 2024.

Both are reported in the company’s data center segment, which came in at $3.7 billion in sales, topping a StreetAccount estimate. Data center sales were up 57% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.

The company’s other major segment, Client and Gaming, includes chips for consumer devices such as laptops, gaming PCs and game consoles. The overall segment rose 28% on an annual basis to $2.9 billion. AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.

Gaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.

AMD’s embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company’s 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.

[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.62 vs. $0.61 expected and revenue of $5.47B vs. $5.46B expected. AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.

[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d)\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday’s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff.

Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol).

Reddit,"Hell, even Netflix has tariffs.","American media stocks tumbled on Monday after President Donald Trump unveiled a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., in his latest levies that could sharply raise costs for Hollywood studios and roil the global entertainment industry.

Trump's announcement was light on details. It did not say whether the duties will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.

Streaming pioneer Netflix could particularly be at risk, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares slumped 4.9% in premarket trading, leading a slide in media stocks.

Reddit,Ford suspends 2025 guidance amid $2.5 billion tariff impact,">DETROIT – Ford Motor beat Wall Street’s first-quarter expectations, but suspended its 2025 financial guidance amid an expected $2.5 billion impact this year from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

>The Detroit automaker said it expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions as well as volume and pricing expectations for a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025.

>Ford cited “near-term risks, especially the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption impacting production” and the potential for future or increased tariffs in the U.S., among other potential impacts such as retaliatory tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance.

>The tariff impact is notably less than the $4 billion to $5 billion that General Motors said it expected to incur as a result of Trump’s tariffs, as Ford imports fewer vehicles than its crosstown rival. GM said it expected to offset at least 30% of those expenses.

Looks like Ford is not providing guidance for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.

Reddit,"Comcast’s cable spinoff to be named Versant, picked to emphasize corporate versatility","Comcast’s spinoff of the majority of its NBCUniversal cable network portfolio will be named Versant, the company said Tuesday, ending a months-long process to select a new corporate moniker.

The new company chose Versant (pronounced like the root of the word conversant) to emphasize its versatility and its familiarity with multiple subjects, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Lazarus, who spoke in an interview. Versant, which had been called SpinCo until a permanent name was chose, will own cable networks including USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel. It will also house digital assets Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow, GolfPass and SportsEngine.

The rest of Comcast’s NBCUniversal portfolio, including the broadcast network, Peacock streaming service, Universal Studios, the theme parks and Bravo, will remain with Comcast.

The new name itself isn’t meant to be consumer-facing. Lazarus wants Versant to be viewed as a house of brands, with each individual asset interacting with users rather than the corporate holding entity.

“We’re going to focus on the individual brands that we have, not the corporate name,” Lazarus said. “This is a holding company name. It’s going to be used for business-to-business purposes.”

Versant is on track to be spun out from Comcast before the end of 2025, Lazarus confirmed. The assets held by the new company generated about $7 billion in revenue last year.

The company’s emphasis on versatility is notable given the rapidly changing media ecosystem. Lazarus will need to build a Wall Street growth narrative for investors once the company starts trading publicly. That will include making acquisitions to build on the company’s core. Some of those transactions may step outside pure media plays, he said.

Lazarus cited Golf Channel’s acquisition of GolfNow, a tee-time reservation company, as an example of how the brands can move beyond linear TV and streaming to build profitable businesses.

“Most people don’t know that GolfNow is even part of our company,” Lazarus said. “We are not going to be purely a collection of linear and digital media assets.”

For a brand such as CNBC, that may include acquiring personal finance or fintech platforms, Lazarus said. For MSNBC, Lazarus said he’s already had some preliminary conversations about potentially buying podcasts that cater to Democrats. He noted if he were to make such an acquisition, the plan wouldn’t be to put that programming on air for MSNBC, but to have it operate as a separate business unit using the cable network as a marketing funnel.

Versant will not launch its own streaming service, Lazarus said. It will instead rely on brands to develop their own digital strategies.

About 20% of the company’s revenue is already digital in nature, Lazarus said. Versant is also likely to return money to shareholders via a dividend, CNBC reported in November.

One strategy the company isn’t likely to pursue is to acquire a group of cable networks.

Lazarus said he has little interest in accumulating more debt attached to low-growth assets. If a cable network also had associated businesses that had better growth prospects, that could be more appealing on a case-by-case basis, he said.

Versant is also unlikely to acquire TV station groups in the current regulatory environment, Lazarus said. Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr told CNBC’s Sara Eisen Monday that national news media companies including NBC are “exercising more and more control” on local TV stations, which he said was not “a good thing for the country.”

# Selecting Versant

Comcast relied on marketing employees from each of SpinCo’s brands to help decide on a name.

Meetings began in late December, according to people familiar with the process. After a few weeks, the company had more than 1,000 potential names. Employees were told to focus on names that drew upon New York, cable TV or passing references to 30 Rockefeller Center, NBCUniversal’s headquarters, said the people.

The names were then filtered for legal and trademark infringement issues and other potential problems, such as a word’s definition in various languages. Comcast also hired three marketing agencies to help generate names and cull the list.

Lawyers passed through just 43 of the initial names, Lazarus said. That list was shortened to about a dozen finalists, which were then each presented to the deciding committee.

Lazarus and his marketing team chose Versant in the past few weeks. The word means “a region of land sloping in one general direction,” according to some references.

Lazarus joked that an uphill slope reminded him of “a rising stock price.”

Reddit,Tourism and stocks,"I've written about this before, but it's summer soon (I think we've had ours in the UK (We had a week of 'hot' weather), so I'll say this again: 

It would not surprise me to see businesses suffer because of a lack of people wanting to go to the USA this year. International tourism contributed a staggering 3% to US GDP in 2022 (nearly THREE TRILLION DOLLARS) and 9 million jobs. 

By the way the administration has treated foreigners in general (ie suspicion and backstabbing), people aren't going to go: ""Hey, I'd love to visit the USA right now! Everyone's sooooo welcome!!"", and that's going to hurt.

> Berkshire Hathaway shares are under pressure Monday as investors process Warren Buffett’s surprise announcement to step down and envision a new path for the conglomerate after his legendary 60-year run. Buffett, 94, picked the very last moment at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, to tell his loyal shareholders that it’s time for Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, to replace him as CEO. The board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Buffett to remain as chairman.

> “Shareholders should welcome this transparent transition, but also have confidence that Warren isn’t going anywhere,” said Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds and a Berkshire shareholder. “Retaining the position of Chairman means he can continue to mentor Greg and the Berkshire leaders, while also providing additional intellectual capacity when the inevitable time for more major capital allocation occurs.”

> It marks an end of an epic era for Berkshire, which was a failing New England textile mill six decades ago when Buffett used an investment partnership he ran to take control. Berkshire has grown into a one-of-a-kind juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion with businesses encompassing insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing and energy. Buffett is handing over his reins on a particularly high note as Berkshire shares just reached a new peak Friday. “Buffett leaves a company that is less reliant on his investing capabilities, with an array of leading businesses with strong cash flows,” Brian Meredith, UBS’ Berkshire analyst, said in a note. “Operationally, we expect little change at BRK and the culture/strategy to remain unchanged under Abel.”",2025-05-05 10:47:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kfdfjv/berkshire_hathaway_shares_fall_after_shocking/,2025-05-05 10:47:15,"Berkshire Hathaway shares fall after shocking Buffett exit and an earnings decline. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/berkshire-hathaway-shares-dip-nearly-3percent-after-shocking-buffett-exit-and-an-earnings-decline.html

At its peak, the gap between the highest-rated paper — known as Tier 1 — and T-bills stood at the widest level since August 2022.

Reddit,Hollywood studio stocks fall after Trump proposes foreign film tariff,"Investors in Hollywood’s top studios and streaming services were spooked Monday after President Donald Trump proposed implementing a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery fell ahead of the opening bell, with Comcast-owned Universal also trading slightly down. Here’s how those share moves shook out:

* Netflix down more than 5%
* Disney down more than 3%
* WBD down more than 3%
* Paramount down more than 2%
* Comcast down less than 1%

Trump called tax incentives offered by foreign countries “a national security threat” in a post on Truth Social Sunday night. He said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose a levy on all films produced abroad that are sent to the United States.

How Trump intends to implement these duties is unclear, as is exactly who is being targeted and who would foot that potential tariff bill.

Hollywood studios have long filmed movies overseas, either for tax benefits or to capture the natural setting of international locations. Some films are shot in multiple countries, with many studios having satellite production hubs around the globe.

When Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, a popular filming location for Hollywood movies and television shows, industry experts told CNBC that it wouldn’t have a major impact on production. After all, the majority of projects are shot digitally, and transporting the final product can be done online or with a data storage device. There isn’t a physical good that exchanges hands in the same way as, say, toys or clothing that’s made in another country.

Questions are already swirling. What part of the production process would be hit with this duty? Would it apply only to movie projects or will TV shows filmed internationally also incur this levy? Are already completed projects exempt?

Additionally, as with the first round of tariff announcements earlier this year, industry experts worry about how these duties will impact relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup lofty film budgets. China has already closed its doors to Hollywood product. Other regions could retaliate and do the same.

Investors in Hollywood’s top studios and streaming services were spooked Monday after President Donald Trump proposed implementing a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Trump called tax incentives offered by foreign countries “a national security threat” in a post on Truth Social Sunday night. He said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose a levy on all films produced abroad that are sent to the United States.

How Trump intends to implement these duties is unclear, as is exactly who is being targeted and who would foot that potential tariff bill.

Hollywood studios have long filmed movies overseas, either for tax benefits or to capture the natural setting of international locations. Some films are shot in multiple countries, with many studios having satellite production hubs around the globe.

When Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, a popular filming location for Hollywood movies and television shows, industry experts told CNBC that it wouldn’t have a major impact on production. After all, the majority of projects are shot digitally, and transporting the final product can be done online or with a data storage device. There isn’t a physical good that exchanges hands in the same way as, say, toys or clothing that’s made in another country.

Questions are already swirling. What part of the production process would be hit with this duty? Would it apply only to movie projects or will TV shows filmed internationally also incur this levy? Are already completed projects exempt?

McKinsey’s new report paints a massive, GPU‑hungry future for AI infrastructure. Analysts estimate global data‑center capacity will almost triple by 2030, with 70 % of the load coming from AI workloads. Meeting that demand will require nearly $7 TRILLION in capex, including $5.2 T earmarked for AI alone. Crucially, about 60 % of the total—roughly $3.1 T—will flow to “technology developers & designers,” the category that explicitly lists NVIDIA as the key supplier of the chips that power AI. In other words, three out of every five dollars poured into the coming compute build‑out lands in Jensen’s backyard.   

The report also explains why NVIDIA is poised to convert this investment tidal wave into outsized profits. GPUs remain the default engine for both training and inference, and McKinsey notes that only a handful of companies can supply them at scale—a textbook supply‑side moat. Meanwhile, hyperscalers, governments, and enterprises are locked in an arms race to deploy proprietary AI capacity, effectively guaranteeing multi‑year demand visibility and pricing power for whoever controls the silicon. Put it all together, McKinsey’s forecast isn’t just bullish for GPUs—it’s a $3‑trillion endorsement of NVIDIA’s roadmap.

Reddit,"GTA VI is my first real stock play: TTWO + SONY. in anticipation of GTAVI, here’s how I’m doing it.","So yeah this is my first time investing in the market, but I’ve been sitting on this idea since the first GTA VI trailer dropped.

I bought **100 shares of TTWO (parent company of R\*)** at $228.08. My plan is simple: sell 70 shares in April 2026, before launch, while the hype’s peaking and everyone’s scrambling to get in. Hold the other 30 through launch, just in case the sales numbers or GTA Online blow it up even more after release.

On top of that, I’m planning to throw $5K or possibly more into SONY stock around late November of this year. They’re not making the game, obviously, but PlayStation is clearly the lead platform with the trailer ends with “Captured on PS5,” and if history repeats itself, there’ll be a hardware bundle, exclusive content, maybe even a special edition console. It’s a safer, slower play  even if GTA doesn’t move SONY’s price much, the company’s diversified enough that I’m fine holding it long term.

Also  I don’t fully trust the May 2026 release date. It’s Rockstar. It’ll probably get delayed again. But to be expected and not a personal red flag just a hiccup. That’s just how they operate, and the market seems to get that. TTWO barely moved when R\* delayed the title, which tells me it wasn’t a surprise.

Just wondering if anyone else is thinking about this, particularly the TWOO + SONY combo

Also  I don’t fully trust the May 2026 release date. It’s Rockstar. It’ll probably get delayed again. But to be expected and not a personal red flag just a hiccup. That’s just how they operate, and the market seems to get that. TTWO barely moved when R\* delayed the title, which tells me it wasn’t a surprise.

Just wondering if anyone else is thinking about this, particularly the TWOO + SONY combo

So yeah this is my first time investing in the market, but I’ve been sitting on this idea since the first GTA VI trailer dropped.

I bought **100 shares of TTWO (parent company of R\*)** at $228.08. My plan is simple: sell 70 shares in April 2026, before launch, while the hype’s peaking and everyone’s scrambling to get in. Hold the other 30 through launch, just in case the sales numbers or GTA Online blow it up even more after release.

On top of that, I’m planning to throw $5K or possibly more into SONY stock around late November of this year.

It seems like the market has collective amnesia about the upcoming semiconductor tariffs. How should we play this? I imagine the currently excluded product categories will be swept up under this new separate tariff regime, such as smartphones. 

Do we expect this to stack on top of other tariffs for categories that didn't receive exclusions from the retaliatory tariffs?

A 100% tax on foreign films in the U.S. would have major global consequences, especially if it leads to retaliatory tariffs. Although most films in U.S. theaters are domestically produced, Hollywood depends on international markets, which account for over 50% of box office revenue for studios like Disney, Warner Bros (owned by AT&T), and Universal (owned by Comcast). If countries like Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Italy, UK, France, India, or Germany respond with their own 100% tariffs, the financial hit to these studios would be severe.

Domestically, the impact would be more cultural. U.S. distributors would likely avoid acquiring foreign films, limiting the variety of content in theaters. Film festivals such as Sundance, Tribeca, and Telluride, known for showcasing international cinema, could lose vital programming, leading to reduced attendance and economic losses for hotels, restaurants, and transportation services, especially in smaller cities.

Theater chains like AMC and Cinemark might not see a major drop in volume, but the reduced diversity would weaken the moviegoing experience over time. IMAX, which depends on high-quality global content, could suffer as well. Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube (owned by Alphabet) would face shrinking access to international titles, affecting audience appeal and international subscriber growth.

Major U.S. blockbusters, such as Marvel films (Disney) and Fast & Furious (Universal), rely on foreign box office returns to break even. If reciprocal tariffs make these films too expensive or inaccessible abroad, studios could lose billions. This might force cutbacks in production, international marketing, or even lead them to pull out of certain markets.

Investor confidence could fall, with stocks of Disney, Netflix, AMC, IMAX, and Comcast all at risk. Meanwhile, international film industries could gain market share and cultural influence. Though U.S. theaters mainly show American films, the global film industry is deeply interconnected. A 100% tariff on foreign films will be damaging for U.S. exports, weakening festivals, and starting another cultural war that harms the U.S. entertainment industry’s future.

Netflix, a major producer with an international market from which it derives a substantial portion of its revenue had a recent closing price was $1,156.49 near 52 weeks high of $1,159.44. A dip would not be surprising.

A 100% tax on foreign films in the U.S. would have major global consequences, especially if it leads to retaliatory tariffs. Although most films in U.S. theaters are domestically produced, Hollywood depends on international markets, which account for over 50% of box office revenue for studios like Disney, Warner Bros (owned by AT&T), and Universal (owned by Comcast). If countries like Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Italy, UK, France, India, or Germany respond with their own 100% tariffs, the financial hit to these studios would be severe.

Domestically, the impact would be more cultural. U.S. distributors would likely avoid acquiring foreign films, limiting the variety of content in theaters. Film festivals such as Sundance, Tribeca, and Telluride, known for showcasing international cinema, could lose vital programming, leading to reduced attendance and economic losses for hotels, restaurants, and transportation services, especially in smaller cities.

Theater chains like AMC and Cinemark might not see a major drop in volume, but the reduced diversity would weaken the moviegoing experience over time. IMAX, which depends on high-quality global content, could suffer as well. Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube (owned by Alphabet) would face shrinking access to international titles, affecting audience appeal and international subscriber growth.

Major U.S. blockbusters, such as Marvel films (Disney) and Fast & Furious (Universal), rely on foreign box office returns to break even. If reciprocal tariffs make these films too expensive or inaccessible abroad, studios could lose billions. This might force cutbacks in production, international marketing, or even lead them to pull out of certain markets.

Reddit,"Impact of upcoming 100% tariffs on Foreign Movies for the US entertainment industry and related stocks (AMC, Disney, Netflix, Amazon)","[https://ca.news.yahoo.com/president-trump-threatens-100-tariffs-001119721.html](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/president-trump-threatens-100-tariffs-001119721.html)

A 100% tax on foreign films in the U.S. would have major global consequences, especially if it leads to retaliatory tariffs. Although most films in U.S. theaters are domestically produced, Hollywood depends on international markets, which account for over 50% of box office revenue for studios like Disney, Warner Bros (owned by AT&T), and Universal (owned by Comcast). If countries like Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Italy, UK, France, India, or Germany respond with their own 100% tariffs, the financial hit to these studios would be severe.

Domestically, the impact would be more cultural. U.S. distributors would likely avoid acquiring foreign films, limiting the variety of content in theaters. Film festivals such as Sundance, Tribeca, and Telluride, known for showcasing international cinema, could lose vital programming, leading to reduced attendance and economic losses for hotels, restaurants, and transportation services, especially in smaller cities.

Theater chains like AMC and Cinemark might not see a major drop in volume, but the reduced diversity would weaken the moviegoing experience over time. IMAX, which depends on high-quality global content, could suffer as well. Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube (owned by Alphabet) would face shrinking access to international titles, affecting audience appeal and international subscriber growth.

Major U.S. blockbusters, such as Marvel films (Disney) and Fast & Furious (Universal), rely on foreign box office returns to break even. If reciprocal tariffs make these films too expensive or inaccessible abroad, studios could lose billions. This might force cutbacks in production, international marketing, or even lead them to pull out of certain markets.

Reddit,Buckle Up -- We're in for an interesting May,"Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports have triggered precisely the economic disruption The Economist reported, with verified data showing tariff rates soaring to 245% through a rapid April escalation, causing a 0.3% GDP contraction and manufacturing activity plummeting to record lows.

Shipping routes from China are experiencing a severe 44% drop in vessel traffic while Vietnamese routes surge 43% in cost, demonstrating how quickly supply chains are shifting to avoid the tariffs.

Companies are adapting through multiple strategies: 89% of businesses surveyed have canceled Chinese orders, firms are paying 60% premiums for scarce bonded warehouse space, and manufacturers like Apple are shifting production bases (moving most US iPhone production to India despite 5-8% higher manufacturing costs).

The full economic impact will follow historical patterns with peak negative effects (-0.9 percentage points) materializing over the next year, consistent with previous tariff implementations.

Perhaps most fascinating is the political dimension revealed in David Autor's research: despite measurable economic harm, tariff-affected regions show increased Republican support, reflecting what economists call ""expressive views of politics"" rather than economic self-interest.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. 

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

Reddit,Is PayPal Ads the solution?,"PayPal has dropped tremendously from its covid hype and has been trading very low for the last few years - even in comparison to pre-covid. Numbers are way up, buybacks are announced regularly, yet we‘re trading at pre-covid levels with not much hope.

PayPal has recently released PayPal Ads in the US and is planning to expand into UK and Germany soonish. This effort is led by Mark Grether who has a lot of experience in ads and has already proven that for Amazon and Uber.

Related releases are also happening like „Offsite Ads“ and it looks like PayPal finally woke up.

Do you think that this is a good direction for the company to invest into and will this help in turning the stock back to a growth stock?

Reddit,My interpretations what Warren Buffett and Greg Abel said yesterday.,"1) Warren Buffett said that Apple has made more money for Berkshire than he has made for Berkshire. **As he said ""has made"", I assume that he still holds Apple (Even in Q2).** 

2) Warren Buffett said that he does not intend to sell 5 Japanese trading houses even if interest rates would get higher in Japan. Greg Abel continued that he is planning to hold them and to cooperate with those firms over 50 years. **Probably, Berkshire Hathaway could potentially invest in Japanese banks or insurance companies additionally when they are open to hold Japanese firms even inspite of higher rates.**

3) Warren Buffett continued that Japan is a wonderful place because Apple, American Express and Coca Cola are doing very well in Japan. **My interpretation is that he is pointing out that the domestic market in Japan will grow and the ""lost 30 years"" are probably over.**

4) His cash pile has grown, but he said that Berkshire Hathaway could use this cash pile in the next 5 years.

Reddit,M. Burry was right about apple stocks," Trump’s new tariffs are hitting hard. Even if the iPhone dodged the worst, Apple’s still coughing up nearly $1B in extra costs, and shifting production to India or Vietnam isn’t a quick fix.

Then there’s the innovation problem. iPhone 16e doesn't make a lot of sense. And the foldable iPhone? Still just a rumor while Samsung folds and flips since day 1 of the  fold technology. 

And let’s not forget “Apple Intelligence”, a big move that isn't working at all like they promised, it’s underwhelming, late, and buggy. Siri still can’t hold a decent convo while others are pushing boundaries.

Reddit,Adobe Stock Is Now Demonstrating A Strong Return on Capital,"[https://franknez.com/adobe-stock-is-now-demonstrating-a-strong-return-on-capital/](https://franknez.com/adobe-stock-is-now-demonstrating-a-strong-return-on-capital/)

Adobe’s ability to generate strong returns on its invested capital is a testament to its operational efficiency and market dominance.

As of recent reports, Adobe boasts an impressive ROCE of 39%, significantly surpassing the software industry’s average benchmark.

This metric highlights Adobe’s proficiency in allocating capital to profitable ventures, particularly in its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments.

Unlike competitors, Adobe’s high ROCE reflects its ability to reinvest earnings effectively, driving sustained growth and shareholder value. 

Adobe’s financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 underscores its growth trajectory.

The company reported a record revenue of $5.71 billion, marking a 10% year-over-year increase.

This growth is primarily driven by a 12% surge in the Digital Media segment, fueled by rising subscription revenues and the integration of generative AI features, such as Firefly and AI-assisted tools in Acrobat.

These advancements have solidified Adobe’s position as a leader in creative and enterprise software solutions, enhancing its appeal to both professional and prosumer markets.

Analyst confidence in Adobe Stock remains strong, with 33 respected analysts projecting an average one-year target price of $498.86, ranging from a high of $660.00 to a low of $380.00.",2025-05-05 19:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kfqedw/adobe_stock_is_now_demonstrating_a_strong_return/,2025-05-05 19:36:51,"Adobe Stock Is Now Demonstrating A Strong Return on Capital.
